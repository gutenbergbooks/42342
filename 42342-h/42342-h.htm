number), in mathematics, a word invented by John Napier to
denote a particular class of function discovered by him, and
which may be defined as follows: if a, x, m are any three
quantities satisfying the equation a<span class="sp">x</span> = m, then a is called the base,
and x is said to be the logarithm of m to the base a. This relation
between x, a, m, may be expressed also by the equation x = log<span class="su">a</span> m.</p>

<p class="noind">which may be readily deduced from the definition of a logarithm.
It follows from these equations that the logarithm of the product
of any number of quantities is equal to the sum of the logarithms
of the quantities, that the logarithm of the quotient of two
quantities is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished
by the logarithm of the denominator, that the logarithm of the
rth power of a quantity is equal to r times the logarithm of the
quantity, and that the logarithm of the rth root of a quantity
is equal to (1/r)th of the logarithm of the quantity.</p>

<p>Logarithms were originally invented for the sake of abbreviating
arithmetical calculations, as by their means the operations
of multiplication and division may be replaced by those of
addition and subtraction, and the operations of raising to powers
and extraction of roots by those of multiplication and division.
For the purpose of thus simplifying the operations of arithmetic,
the base is taken to be 10, and use is made of tables of
logarithms in which the values of x, the logarithm, corresponding
to values of m, the number, are tabulated. The
logarithm is also a function of frequent occurrence in analysis,
being regarded as a known and recognized function like sin x or
tan x; but in mathematical investigations the base generally
employed is not 10, but a certain quantity usually denoted by the
letter e, of value 2.71828 18284....</p>

<p>Thus in arithmetical calculations if the base is not expressed
it is understood to be 10, so that log m denotes log<span class="su">10</span> m; but in
analytical formulae it is understood to be e.</p>

<p>The logarithms to base 10 of the first twelve numbers to 7
places of decimals are</p>

<p>The integral part of a logarithm is called the index or characteristic,
and the fractional part the mantissa. When the base
is 10, the logarithms of all numbers in which the digits are the
same, no matter where the decimal point may be, have the same
mantissa; thus, for example,</p>

<p class="center">log 2.5613 = 0.4084604, &emsp; log 25.613 = 1.4084604, &emsp; log 2561300 =
6.4084604, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the case of fractional numbers (<i>i.e.</i> numbers in which the
integral part is 0) the mantissa is still kept positive, so that,
for example,</p>

<p class="center">log .25613 = <span class="ov">1</span>.4084604, &emsp; log .0025613 = <span class="ov">3</span>.4084604, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="noind">the minus sign being usually written over the characteristic,
and not before it, to indicate that the characteristic only, and
not the whole expression, is negative; thus</p>

<p class="center"><span class="ov">1</span>.4084604 stands for &minus;1 + .4084604.</p>

<p class="noind">The fact that when the base is 10 the mantissa of the logarithm
is independent of the position of the decimal point in the number
affords the chief reason for the choice of 10 as base. The explanation
of this property of the base 10 is evident, for a change
in the position of the decimal points amounts to multiplication
or division by some power of 10, and this corresponds to the
addition or subtraction of some integer in the case of the
logarithm, the mantissa therefore remaining intact. It should
be mentioned that in most tables of trigonometrical functions,
the number 10 is added to all the logarithms in the table in order
to avoid the use of negative characteristics, so that the characteristic
9 denotes in reality <span class="ov">1</span>, 8 denotes <span class="ov">2</span>, 10 denotes 0, &amp;c.
Logarithms thus increased are frequently referred to for the sake
of distinction as <i>tabular logarithms</i>, so that the tabular logarithm
= the true logarithm + 10.</p>

<p>In tables of logarithms of numbers to base 10 the mantissa
only is in general tabulated, as the characteristic of the logarithm
of a number can always be written down at sight, the rule being
that, if the number is greater than unity, the characteristic is
less by unity than the number of digits in the integral portion of
it, and that if the number is less than unity the characteristic
is negative, and is greater by unity than the number of ciphers
between the decimal point and the first significant figure.</p>

<p>It follows very simply from the definition of a logarithm that</p>

<p class="center">log<span class="su">a</span> b × log<span class="su">b</span> a = 1, &emsp; log<span class="su">b</span> m = log<span class="su">a</span> m × (1/log<span class="su">a</span> b).</p>

<p>The second of these relations is an important one, as it shows
that from a table of logarithms to base a, the corresponding
table of logarithms to base b may be deduced by multiplying all
the logarithms in the former by the constant multiplier 1/log<span class="su">a</span> b,
which is called the <i>modulus</i> of the system whose base is b with
respect to the system whose base is a.</p>

<p>The two systems of logarithms for which extensive tables
have been calculated are the Napierian, or hyperbolic, or natural
system, of which the base is e, and the Briggian, or decimal, or
common system, of which the base is 10; and we see that the
logarithms in the latter system may be deduced from those in the
former by multiplication by the constant multiplier 1/log<span class="su">e</span> 10,
which is called the modulus of the common system of logarithms.
The numerical value of this modulus is 0.43429 44819 03251
82765 11289 ..., and the value of its reciprocal, log<span class="sp">e</span> 10 (by
multiplication by which Briggian logarithms may be converted
into Napierian logarithms) is 2.30258 50929 94045 68401
79914 ....</p>

<p>The quantity denoted by e is the series,</p>

<p><i>The logarithmic Function.</i>&mdash;The mathematical function log x or
log<span class="su">e</span> x is one of the small group of transcendental functions, consisting
only of the circular functions (direct and inverse) sin x, cos x,
&amp;c., arc sin x or sin<span class="sp">&minus;1</span> x,&amp;c., log x and e<span class="sp">x</span> which are universally treated
in analysis as known functions. The notation log x is generally
employed in English and American works, but on the continent of
Europe writers usually denote the function by lx or lg x. The
logarithmic function is most naturally introduced into analysis by
the equation</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">log x = <span class="f150">&int;</span><span class="sp1">x</span><span class="su1">1</span></td> <td>dt</td>
<td rowspan="2">, (x &gt; 0).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom">t</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">This equation defines log x for positive values of x; if x &le; 0 the
formula ceases to have any meaning. Thus log x is the integral
function of 1/x, and it can be shown that log x is a genuinely new
transcendent, not expressible in finite terms by means of functions
such as algebraical or circular functions. A connexion with the
circular functions, however, appears later when the definition of
log x is extended to complex values of x.</p>

<p>A relation which is of historical interest connects the logarithmic
function with the quadrature of the hyperbola, for, by considering
the equation of the hyperbola in the form xy = const., it is evident
that the area included between the arc of a hyperbola, its nearest
asymptote, and two ordinates drawn parallel to the other asymptote
from points on the first asymptote distant a and b from their point
of intersection, is proportional to log b/a.</p>

<p>The following fundamental properties of log x are readily deducible
from the definition</p>

<p>(i.) log xy = log x + log y.</p>

<p>(ii.) Limit of (x<span class="sp">h</span> &minus; 1)/h = log x, when h is indefinitely diminished.</p>

<p>Either of these properties might be taken as itself the definition of
log x.</p>

<p>There is no series for log x proceeding either by ascending or
descending powers of x, but there is an expansion for log (1 + x), viz.</p>

<p class="center">log (1 + x) = x &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> x<span class="sp">2</span> + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> x<span class="sp">3</span> &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> x<span class="sp">4</span> + ...;</p>

<p class="noind">the series, however, is convergent for real values of x only when x lies
between +1 and &minus;1. Other formulae which are deducible from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page869" id="page869"></a>869</span>
equation are given in the portion of this article relating to the calculation
of logarithms.</p>

<p>The function log x as x increases from 0 towards &infin; steadily increases
from &minus;&infin; towards +&infin;. It has the important property that
it tends to infinity with x, but more slowly than any power of x, <i>i.e.</i>
that x<span class="sp">&minus;m</span> log x tends to zero as x tends to &infin; for every positive value
of m however small.</p>

<p>The <i>exponential function</i>, exp x, may be defined as the inverse of
the logarithm: thus x = exp y if y = log x. It is positive for all values
of y and increases steadily from 0 toward &infin; as y increases from -&infin;
towards +&infin;. As y tends towards &infin;, exp y tends towards &infin;
more rapidly than any power of y.</p>

<p>The exponential function possesses the properties</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">

<p>From (i.) and (ii.) it may be deduced that</p>

<p class="center">exp x = (1 + 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... )<span class="sp">x</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">where the right-hand side denotes the positive xth power of the
number 1 + 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... usually denoted by e. It is customary,
therefore, to denote the exponential function by e<span class="sp">x</span> and the
result</p>

<p class="center">e<span class="sp">x</span> = 1 + x + x<span class="sp">2</span>/2! + x<span class="sp">3</span>/3! ...</p>

<p class="noind">is known as the <i>exponential theorem</i>.</p>

<p>The definitions of the logarithmic and exponential functions may
be extended to complex values of x. Thus if x = &xi; + i&eta;</p>

<p class="noind">where the path of integration in the plane of the complex variable t
is any curve which does not pass through the origin; but now log x
is not a uniform function, that is to say, if x describes a closed curve
it does not follow that log x also describes a closed curve: in fact
we have</p>

<p class="center">log (&xi; + i&eta;) = log &radic;(&xi;<span class="sp">2</span> + &eta;<span class="sp">2</span>) + i(&alpha; + 2n&pi;),</p>

<p class="noind">where &alpha; is the numerically least angle whose cosine and sine are
&xi;/&radic;(&xi;<span class="sp">2</span> + &eta;<span class="sp">2</span>) and &eta;/&radic;(&xi;<span class="sp">2</span> + &eta;<span class="sp">2</span>), and n denotes any integer. Thus even
when the argument is real log x has an infinite number of values; for
putting &eta; = 0 and taking &xi; positive, in which case &alpha; = 0, we obtain for
log &xi; the infinite system of values log &xi; + 2n&pi;i. It follows from this
property of the function that we cannot have for log x a series which
shall be convergent for all values of x, as is the case with sin x and
cos x, for such a series could only represent a uniform function, and in
fact the equation</p>

<p class="center">log(1 + x) = x &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>x<span class="sp">2</span> + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>x<span class="sp">3</span> &minus; <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>x<span class="sp">4</span> + ...</p>

<p class="noind">is true only when the analytical modulus of x is less than unity.
The exponential function, which may still be defined as the inverse
of the logarithmic function, is, on the other hand, a uniform function
of x, and its fundamental properties may be stated in the same form
as for real values of x. Also</p>

<p class="center">exp (&xi; &minus; i&eta;) = e<span class="sp">&xi;</span> (cos &eta; + i sin &eta;).</p>

<p>An alternative method of developing the theory of the exponential
function is to start from the definition</p>

<p class="center">exp x = 1 + x + x<span class="sp">2</span>/2! + x<span class="sp">3</span>/3! + ...,</p>

<p class="noind">the series on the right-hand being convergent for all values of x and
therefore defining an analytical function of x which is uniform and
regular all over the plane.</p>

<p><i>Invention and Early History of Logarithms.</i>&mdash;The invention of
logarithms has been accorded to John Napier, baron of Merchiston
in Scotland, with a unanimity which is rare with regard to
important scientific discoveries: in fact, with the exception of
the tables of Justus Byrgius, which will be referred to further on,
there seems to have been no other mathematician of the time
whose mind had conceived the principle on which logarithms
depend, and no partial anticipations of the discovery are met
with in previous writers.</p>

<p>The first announcement of the invention was made in Napier&rsquo;s
<i>Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio ...</i> (Edinburgh,
1614). The work is a small quarto containing fifty-seven pages
of explanatory matter and a table of ninety pages (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napier,
John</a></span>). The nature of logarithms is explained by reference to
the motion of points in a straight line, and the principle upon
which they are based is that of the correspondence of a geometrical
and an arithmetical series of numbers. The table gives
the logarithms of sines for every minute of seven figures; it is
arranged semi-quadrantally, so that the <i>differentiae</i>, which are
the differences of the two logarithms in the same line, are the
logarithms of the tangents. Napier&rsquo;s logarithms are not the
logarithms now termed Napierian or hyperbolic, that is to say,
logarithms to the base <i>e</i> where <i>e</i> = 2.7182818...; the relation
between N (a sine) and L its logarithm, as defined in the <i>Canonis
Descriptio</i>, being N = 10<span class="sp">7</span> e<span class="sp">&minus;L/(l0<span class="sp">7</span>)</span>, so that (ignoring the factors 10<span class="sp">7</span>,
the effect of which is to render sines and logarithms integral to
7 figures), the base is e<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>. Napier&rsquo;s logarithms decrease as the
sines increase. If l denotes the logarithm to base e (that is, the
so-called &ldquo;Napierian&rdquo; or hyperbolic logarithm) and L denotes,
as above, &ldquo;Napier&rsquo;s&rdquo; logarithm, the connexion between <i>l</i> and
L is expressed by</p>

<p class="center">L = 10<span class="sp">7</span> log<span class="su">e</span> 10<span class="sp">7</span> &minus; 10<span class="sp">7</span> l or e<span class="sp">l</span> = 10<span class="sp">7</span> e<span class="sp">&minus;L/(10<span class="sp">7</span>)</span></p>

<p>Napier&rsquo;s work (which will henceforth in this article be referred
to as the <i>Descriptio</i>) immediately on its appearance in 1614
attracted the attention of perhaps the two most eminent English
mathematicians then living&mdash;Edward Wright and Henry Briggs.
The former translated the work into English; the latter was
concerned with Napier in the change of the logarithms from those
originally invented to decimal or common logarithms, and it is
to him that the original calculation of the logarithmic tables now
in use is mainly due. Both Napier and Wright died soon after
the publication of the <i>Descriptio</i>, the date of Wright&rsquo;s death
being 1615 and that of Napier 1617, but Briggs lived until 1631.
Edward Wright, who was a fellow of Caius College, Cambridge,
occupies a conspicuous place in the history of navigation. In
1599 he published <i>Certaine errors in Navigation detected and
corrected</i>, and he was the author of other works; to him also is
chiefly due the invention of the method known as Mercator&rsquo;s
sailing. He at once saw the value of logarithms as an aid to
navigation, and lost no time in preparing a translation, which
he submitted to Napier himself. The preface to Wright&rsquo;s
edition consists of a translation of the preface to the <i>Descriptio</i>,
together with the addition of the following sentences written by
Napier himself: &ldquo;But now some of our countreymen in this
Island well affected to these studies, and the more publique
good, procured a most learned Mathematician to translate the
same into our vulgar English tongue, who after he had finished it,
sent the Coppy of it to me, to bee seene and considered on by
myselfe. I having most willingly and gladly done the same, finde
it to bee most exact and precisely conformable to my minde and
the originall. Therefore it may please you who are inclined to
these studies, to receive it from me and the Translator, with
as much good will as we recommend it unto you.&rdquo; There is a
short &ldquo;preface to the reader&rdquo; by Briggs, and a description of a
triangular diagram invented by Wright for finding the proportional
parts. The table is printed to one figure less than in the
<i>Descriptio</i>. Edward Wright died, as has been mentioned, in
1615, and his son, Samuel Wright, in the preface states that his
father &ldquo;gave much commendation of this work (and often in my
hearing) as of very great use to mariners&rdquo;; and with respect to
the translation he says that &ldquo;shortly after he had it returned
out of Scotland, it pleased God to call him away afore he could
publish it.&rdquo; The translation was published in 1616. It was also
reissued with a new title-page in 1618.</p>

<p>Henry Briggs, then professor of geometry at Gresham College,
London, and afterwards Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford,
welcomed the <i>Descriptio</i> with enthusiasm. In a letter to Archbishop
Usher, dated Gresham House, March 10, 1615, he wrote,
&ldquo;Napper, lord of Markinston, hath set my head and hands a
work with his new and admirable logarithms. I hope to see him
this summer, if it please God, for I never saw book which pleased
me better, or made me more wonder.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> I purpose to discourse
with him concerning eclipses, for what is there which we may not
hope for at his hands,&rdquo; and he also states &ldquo;that he was wholly
taken up and employed about the noble invention of logarithms
lately discovered.&rdquo; Briggs accordingly visited Napier in 1615,
and stayed with him a whole month.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> He brought with him some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page870" id="page870"></a>870</span>
calculations he had made, and suggested to Napier the advantages
that would result from the choice of 10 as a base, an improvement
which he had explained in his lectures at Gresham College, and
on which he had written to Napier. Napier said that he had
already thought of the change, and pointed out a further improvement,
viz., that the characteristics of numbers greater
than unity should be positive and not negative, as suggested by
Briggs. In 1616 Briggs again visited Napier and showed him the
work he had accomplished, and, he says, he would gladly have
paid him a third visit in 1617 had Napier&rsquo;s life been spared.</p>

<p>Briggs&rsquo;s <i>Logarithmorum chilias prima</i>, which contains the first
published table of decimal or common logarithms, is only a
small octavo tract of sixteen pages, and gives the logarithms
of numbers from unity to 1000 to 14 places of decimals. It was
published, probably privately, in 1617, after Napier&rsquo;s death,<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and
there is no author&rsquo;s name, place or date. The date of publication
is, however, fixed as 1617 by a letter from Sir Henry Bourchier
to Usher, dated December 6, 1617, containing the passage&mdash;&ldquo;Our
kind friend, Mr Briggs, hath lately published a supplement
to the most excellent tables of logarithms, which I presume he
has sent to you.&rdquo; Briggs&rsquo;s tract of 1617 is extremely rare, and
has generally been ignored or incorrectly described. Hutton
erroneously states that it contains the logarithms to 8 places,
and his account has been followed by most writers. There is a
copy in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Briggs continued to labour assiduously at the calculation of
logarithms, and in 1624 published his <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i>,
a folio work containing the logarithms of the numbers from l
to 20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000 (and in some copies to
101,000) to 14 places of decimals. The table occupies 300 pages,
and there is an introduction of 88 pages relating to the mode of
calculation, and the applications of logarithms.</p>

<p>There was thus left a gap between 20,000 and 90,000, which
was filled up by Adrian Vlacq (or Ulaccus), who published at
Gouda, in Holland, in 1628, a table containing the logarithms
of the numbers from unity to 100,000 to 10 places of decimals.
Having calculated 70,000 logarithms and copied only 30,000,
Vlacq would have been quite entitled to have called his a new
work. He designates it, however, only a second edition of
Briggs&rsquo;s <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i>, the title running <i>Arithmetica
logarithmica sive Logarithmorum Chiliades centum, ... editio
secunda aucta per Adrianum Vlacq, Goudanum</i>. This table of
Vlacq&rsquo;s was published, with an English explanation prefixed,
at London in 1631 under the title <i>Logarithmicall Arithmetike ...
London, printed by George Miller</i>, 1631. There are also copies
with the title-page and introduction in French and in Dutch
(Gouda, 1628).</p>

<p>Briggs had himself been engaged in filling up the gap, and in
a letter to John Pell, written after the publication of Vlacq&rsquo;s
work, and dated October 25, 1628, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;My desire was to have those chiliades that are wantinge betwixt
20 and 90 calculated and printed, and I had done them all almost by
my selfe, and by some frendes whom my rules had sufficiently informed,
and by agreement the busines was conveniently parted
amongst us; but I am eased of that charge and care by one Adrian
Vlacque, an Hollander, who hathe done all the whole hundred
chiliades and printed them in Latin, Dutche and Frenche, 1000
bookes in these 3 languages, and hathe sould them almost all. But
he hathe cutt off 4 of my figures throughout; and hathe left out my
dedication, and to the reader, and two chapters the 12 and 13, in the
rest he hath not varied from me at all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The original calculation of the logarithms of numbers from
unity to 101,000 was thus performed by Briggs and Vlacq between
1615 and 1628. Vlacq&rsquo;s table is that from which all the hundreds
of tables of logarithms that have subsequently appeared have
been derived. It contains of course many errors, which were
gradually discovered and corrected in the course of the next
two hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>The first calculation or publication of Briggian or common
logarithms of trigonometrical functions was made in 1620 by
Edmund Gunter, who was Briggs&rsquo;s colleague as professor of
astronomy in Gresham College. The title of Gunter&rsquo;s book,
which is very scarce, is <i>Canon triangulorum</i>, and it contains
logarithmic sines and tangents for every minute of the quadrant
to 7 places of decimals.</p>

<p>The next publication was due to Vlacq, who appended to his
logarithms of numbers in the <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> of 1628
a table giving log sines, tangents and secants for every minute
of the quadrant to 10 places; <span class="correction" title="amended from there">these</span> were obtained by calculating
the logarithms of the natural sines, &amp;c. given in the <i>Thesaurus
mathematicus</i> of Pitiscus (1613).</p>

<p>During the last years of his life Briggs devoted himself to the
calculation of logarithmic sines, &amp;c. and at the time of his death
in 1631 he had all but completed a logarithmic canon to every
hundredth of a degree. This work was published by Vlacq at
his own expense at Gouda in 1633, under the title <i>Trigonometria
Britannica</i>. It contains log sines (to 14 places) and tangents (to
10 places), besides natural sines, tangents and secants, at intervals
of a hundredth of a degree. In the same year Vlacq published
at Gouda his <i>Trigonometria artificialis</i>, giving log sines and
tangents to every 10 seconds of the quadrant to 10 places.
This work also contains the logarithms of numbers from unity
to 20,000 taken from the <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> of 1628.
Briggs appreciated clearly the advantages of a centesimal division
of the quadrant, and by dividing the degree into hundredth parts
instead of into minutes, made a step towards a reformation in
this respect, and but for the appearance of Vlacq&rsquo;s work the
decimal division of the degree might have become recognized,
as is now the case with the corresponding division of the second.
The calculation of the logarithms not only of numbers but also
of the trigonometrical functions is therefore due to Briggs and
Vlacq; and the results contained in their four fundamental
works&mdash;<i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> (Briggs), 1624; <i>Arithmetica
logarithmica</i> (Vlacq), 1628; <i>Trigonometria Britannica</i> (Briggs),
1633; <i>Trigonometria artificialis</i> (Vlacq), 1633&mdash;have not been
superseded by any subsequent calculations.</p>

<p>In the preceding paragraphs an account has been given of the
actual announcement of the invention of logarithms and of the
calculation of the tables. It now remains to refer in more detail
to the invention itself and to examine the claims of Napier and
Briggs to the capital improvement involved in the change from
Napier&rsquo;s original logarithms to logarithms to the base 10.</p>

<p>The <i>Descriptio</i> contained only an explanation of the use of
the logarithms without any account of the manner in which
the canon was constructed. In an &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo; on the seventh
page Napier states that, although in that place the mode of construction
should be explained, he proceeds at once to the use
of the logarithms, &ldquo;ut praelibatis prius usu, et rei utilitate,
caetera aut magis placeant posthac edenda, aut minus saltem
displiceant silentio sepulta.&rdquo; He awaits therefore the judgment
and censure of the learned &ldquo;priusquam caetera in lucem temerè
prolata lividorum detrectationi exponantur&rdquo;; and in an
&ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo; on the last page of the book he states that he
will publish the mode of construction of the canon &ldquo;si huius
inventi usum eruditis gratum fore intellexero.&rdquo; Napier, however,
did not live to keep this promise. In 1617 he published a small
work entitled <i>Rabdologia</i> relating to mechanical methods of
performing multiplications and divisions, and in the same year
he died.</p>

<p>The proposed work was published in 1619 by Robert Napier,
his second son by his second marriage, under the title <i>Mirifici
logarithmorum canonis constructio</i>.... It consists of two
pages of preface followed by sixty-seven pages of text. In the
preface Robert Napier says that he has been assured from undoubted
authority that the new invention is much thought of
by the ablest mathematicians, and that nothing would delight
them more than the publication of the mode of construction
of the canon. He therefore issues the work to satisfy their
desires, although, he states, it is manifest that it would have
seen the light in a far more perfect state if his father could
have put the finishing touches to it; and he mentions that,
in the opinion of the best judges, his father possessed, among
other most excellent gifts, in the highest degree the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page871" id="page871"></a>871</span>
explaining the most difficult matters by a certain and easy method
in the fewest possible words.</p>

<p>It is important to notice that in the <i>Constructio</i> logarithms
are called artificial numbers; and Robert Napier states that the
work was composed several years (<i>aliquot annos</i>) before Napier
had invented the name logarithm. The <i>Constructio</i> therefore
may have been written a good many years previous to the
publication of the <i>Descriptio</i> in 1614.</p>

<p>Passing now to the invention of common or decimal logarithms,
that is, to the transition from the logarithms originally invented
by Napier to logarithms to the base 10, the first allusion to a
change of system occurs in the &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo; on the last page
of the <i>Descriptio</i> (1614), the concluding paragraph of which is
&ldquo;Verùm si huius inventi usum eruditis gratum fore intellexero,
dabo fortasse brevi (Deo aspirante) rationem ac methodum aut
hunc canonem emendandi, aut emendatiorem de novo condendi,
ut ita plurium Logistarum diligentia, limatior tandem et accuratior,
quàm unius opera fieri potuit, in lucem prodeat. Nihil in ortu
perfectum.&rdquo; In some copies, however, this &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo; is
absent. In Wright&rsquo;s translation of 1616 Napier has added the
sentence&mdash;&ldquo;But because the addition and subtraction of these
former numbers may seeme somewhat painfull, I intend (if it
shall please God) in a second Edition, to set out such Logarithmes
as shall make those numbers above written to fall upon decimal
numbers, such as 100,000,000, 200,000,000, 300,000,000, &amp;c.,
which are easie to be added or abated to or from any other
number&rdquo; (p. 19); and in the dedication of the <i>Rabdologia</i> (1617)
he wrote &ldquo;Quorum quidem Logarithmorum speciem aliam multò
praestantiorem nunc etiam invenimus, &amp; creandi methodum,
unà cum eorum usu (si Deus longiorem vitae &amp; valetudinis
usuram concesserit) evulgare statuimus; ipsam autem novi
canonis supputationem, ob infirmam corporis nostri valetudinem,
viris in hoc studii genere versatis relinquimus: imprimis verò
doctissimo viro D. Henrico Briggio Londini publico Geometriae
Professori, et amico mihi longè charissimo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Briggs in the short preface to his <i>Logarithmorum chilias</i>
(1617) states that the reason why his logarithms are different
from those introduced by Napier &ldquo;sperandum, ejus librum
posthumum, abunde nobis propediem satisfacturum.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;liber posthumus&rdquo; was the <i>Constructio</i> (1619), in the preface
to which Robert Napier states that he has added an appendix
relating to another and more excellent species of logarithms, referred
to by the inventor himself in the <i>Rabdologia</i>, and in which
the logarithm of unity is 0. He also mentions that he has
published some remarks upon the propositions in spherical
trigonometry and upon the new species of logarithms by Henry
Briggs, &ldquo;qui novi hujus Canonis supputandi laborem gravissimum,
pro singulari amicitiâ quae illi cum Patre meo L. M. intercessit,
animo libentissimo in se suscepit; creandi methodo, et usuum
explanatione Inventori relictis. Nunc autem ipso ex hâc vitâ
evocato, totius negotii onus doctissimi Briggii humeris incumbere,
et Sparta haec ornanda illi sorte quadam obtigisse videtur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the address prefixed to the <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> (1625)
Briggs bids the reader not to be surprised that these logarithms
are different from those published in the <i>Descriptio</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Ego enim, cum meis auditoribus Londini, publice in Collegio
Greshamensi horum doctrinam explicarem; animadverti multo

voluisset.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There is also a reference to the change of the logarithms on the
title-page of the work.</p>

<p>These extracts contain all the original statements made by
Napier, Robert Napier and Briggs which have reference to the
origin of decimal logarithms. It will be seen that they are all
in perfect agreement. Briggs pointed out in his lectures at
Gresham College that it would be more convenient that 0 should
stand for the logarithm of the whole sine as in the <i>Descriptio</i>,
but that the logarithm of the tenth part of the whole sine should
be 10,000,000,000. He wrote also to Napier at once; and as
soon as he could he went to Edinburgh to visit him, where, as
he was most hospitably received by him, he remained for a
whole month. When they conversed about the change of system,
Napier said that he had perceived and desired the same thing,
but that he had published the tables which he had already prepared,
so that they might be used until he could construct others
more convenient. But he considered that the change ought
to be so made that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and
10,000,000,000 that of the whole sine, which Briggs could not
but admit was by far the most convenient of all. Rejecting
therefore, those which he had prepared already, Briggs began,
at Napier&rsquo;s advice, to consider seriously the question of the
calculation of new tables. In the following summer he went
to Edinburgh and showed Napier the principal portion of the
logarithms which he published in 1624. These probably included
the logarithms of the first chiliad which he published in 1617.</p>

<p>It has been thought necessary to give in detail the facts relating
to the conversion of the logarithms, as unfortunately Charles
Hutton in his history of logarithms, which was prefixed to the
early editions of his <i>Mathematical Tables</i>, and was also published
as one of his <i>Mathematical Tracts</i>, has charged Napier with want
of candour in not telling the world of Briggs&rsquo;s share in the change
of system, and he expresses the suspicion that &ldquo;Napier was
desirous that the world should ascribe to him alone the merit
of this very useful improvement of the logarithms.&rdquo; According
to Hutton&rsquo;s view, the words, &ldquo;<i>it is to be hoped</i> that his posthumous
work&rdquo; ... which occur in the preface to the <i>Chilias</i>, were a
modest hint that the share Briggs had had in changing the
logarithms should be mentioned, and that, as no attention was
paid to it, he himself gave the account which appears in the
<i>Arithmetica</i> of 1624. There seems, however, no ground whatever
for supposing that Briggs meant to express anything beyond his
hope that the reason for the alteration would be explained in
the posthumous work; and in his own account, written seven
years after Napier&rsquo;s death and five years after the appearance
of the work itself, he shows no injured feeling whatever, but
even goes out of his way to explain that he abandoned his own
proposed alteration in favour of Napier&rsquo;s, and, rejecting the
tables he had already constructed, began to consider the calculation
of new ones. The facts, as stated by Napier and Briggs,
are in complete accordance, and the friendship existing between
them was perfect and unbroken to the last. Briggs assisted
Robert Napier in the editing of the &ldquo;posthumous work,&rdquo; the
<i>Constructio</i>, and in the account he gives of the alteration of the
logarithms in the <i>Arithmetica</i> of 1624 he seems to have been
more anxious that justice should be done to Napier than to himself;
while on the other hand Napier received Briggs most
hospitably and refers to him as &ldquo;amico mihi longè charissimo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hutton&rsquo;s suggestions are all the more to be regretted as they
occur as a history which is the result of a good deal of investigation
and which for years was referred to as an authority by many
writers. His prejudice against Napier naturally produced
retaliation, and Mark Napier in defending his ancestor has fallen
into the opposite extreme of attempting to reduce Briggs to
the level of a mere computer. In connexion with this controversy
it should be noticed that the &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo; on the last page
of the <i>Descriptio</i>, containing the reference to the new logarithms,
does not occur in all the copies. It is printed on the back of
the last page of the table itself, and so cannot have been torn
out from the copies that are without it. As there could have
been no reason for omitting it after it had once appeared, we
may assume that the copies which do not have it are those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page872" id="page872"></a>872</span>
were first issued. It is probable, therefore, that Briggs&rsquo;s copy
contained no reference to the change, and it is even possible
that the &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo; may have been added after Briggs had
communicated with Napier. As special attention has not been
drawn to the fact that some copies have the &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo;
and some have not, different writers have assumed that Briggs
did or did not know of the promise contained in the &ldquo;Admonitio&rdquo;
according as it was present or absent in the copies they had
themselves referred to, and this has given rise to some confusion.
It may also be remarked that the date frequently assigned to
Briggs&rsquo;s first visit to Napier is 1616, and not 1615 as stated above,
the reason being that Napier was generally supposed to have
died in 1618 until Mark Napier showed that the true date was
1617. When the <i>Descriptio</i> was published Briggs was fifty-seven
years of age, and the remaining seventeen years of his
life were devoted with steady enthusiasm to extend the utility
of Napier&rsquo;s great invention.</p>

<p>The only other mathematician besides Napier who grasped
the idea on which the use of logarithm depends and applied it
to the construction of a table is Justus Byrgius (Jobst Bürgi),
whose work <i>Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen</i>
... was published at Prague in 1620, six years after the publication
of the <i>Descriptio</i> of Napier. This table distinctly involves
the principle of logarithms and may be described as a modified
table of antilogarithms. It consists of two series of numbers,
the one being an arithmetical and the other a geometrical
progression: thus</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcr">0, 1,0000 0000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">10, 1,0001 0000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">20, l,0002 0001</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">. &ensp; . &ensp; . &ensp; . &ensp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">990, l,0099 4967</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcr">. &ensp; . &ensp; . &ensp; . &ensp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">In the arithmetical column the numbers increase by 10, in the
geometrical column each number is derived from its predecessor
by multiplication by 1.0001. Thus the number 10x in the arithmetical
column corresponds to 10<span class="sp">8</span> (1.0001)<span class="sp">x</span> in the geometrical
column; the intermediate numbers being obtained by interpolation.
If we divide the numbers in the geometrical column
by 10<span class="sp">8</span> the correspondence is between 10x and (1.0001)<span class="sp">x</span>, and
the table then becomes one of antilogarithms, the base being
(1.0001)<span class="sp">1/10</span>, viz. for example (l.0001)<span class="sp">1/10·990</span> = 1.00994967. The
table extends to 230270 in the arithmetical column, and it is
shown that 230270.022 corresponds to 9.9999 9999 or 109 in
the geometrical column; this last result showing that
(1.0001)<span class="sp">23027.022</span> = 10. The first contemporary mention of Byrgius&rsquo;s
table occurs on page 11 of the &ldquo;Praecepta&rdquo; prefixed to Kepler&rsquo;s
<i>Tabulae Radolphinae</i> (1627); his words are: &ldquo;apices logistici
J. Byrgio multis annis ante editionem Neperianam viam praeiverent
ad hos ipsissimos logarithmos. Etsi homo cunctator
et secretorum suorum custos foetum in partu destituit, non ad
usus publicos educavit.&rdquo; Another reference to Byrgius occurs
in a work by Benjamin Bramer, the brother-in-law and pupil
of Byrgius, who, writing in 1630, says that the latter constructed
his table twenty years ago or more.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>As regards priority of publication, Napier has the advantage
by six years, and even fully accepting Bramer&rsquo;s statement,
there are grounds for believing that Napier&rsquo;s work dates from
a still earlier period.</p>

<p>The power of 10, which occurs as a factor in the tables of both
Napier and Byrgius, was rendered necessary by the fact that
the decimal point was not yet in use. Omitting this factor in
the case of both tables, the connexion between N a number and
L its &ldquo;logarithm&rdquo; is</p>

<p class="center">N = (e<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>)<span class="sp">L</span> (Napier), &emsp; L =(1.0001)<span class="sp"><span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span></span>N (Byrgius),</p>

<p class="noind">viz. Napier gives logarithms to base e<span class="sp">-1</span>, Byrgius gives antilogarithms
to base (1.0001)<span class="sp">1/10</span>.</p>

<p>There is indirect evidence that Napier was occupied with
logarithms as early as 1594, for in a letter to P. Crügerus
from Kepler, dated September 9, 1624 (Frisch&rsquo;s <i>Kepler</i>, vi. 47),
there occurs the sentence: &ldquo;Nihil autem supra Neperianam
rationem esse puto: etsi quidem Scotus quidam literis ad
Tychonem 1594 scriptis jam spem fecit Canonis illius Mirifici.&rdquo;
It is here distinctly stated that some Scotsman in the year 1594,
in a letter to Tycho Brahe, gave him some hope of the logarithms;
and as Kepler joined Tycho after his expulsion from the island
of Huen, and had been so closely associated with him in his
work, he would be likely to be correct in any assertion of this
kind. In connexion with Kepler&rsquo;s statement the following story,
told by Anthony wood in the <i>Athenae Oxonienses</i>, is of some
importance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;It must be now known, that one Dr Craig, a Scotchman ...
coming out of Denmark into his own country, called upon Joh.
Neper, Baron of Mercheston, near Edinburgh, and told him, among
other discourses, of a new invention in Denmark (by Longomontanus,
as &rsquo;tis said), to save the tedious multiplication and division in astronomical
calculations. Neper being solicitous to know farther of him
concerning this matter, he could give no other account of it than that
it was by proportional numbers. Which hint Neper taking, he
desired him at his return to call upon him again. Craig, after some
weeks had passed, did so, and Neper then showed him a rude draught
of what he called <i>Canon mirabilis logarithmorum</i>. which draught,
with some alterations, he printing in 1614, it came forthwith into
the hands of our author Briggs, and into those of Will. Oughtred,
from whom the relation of this matter came.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>This story, though obviously untrue in some respects, gives
valuable information by connecting Dr Craig with Napier and
Longomontanus, who was Tycho Brahe&rsquo;s assistant. Dr Craig
was John Craig, the third son of Thomas Craig, who was one of the
colleagues of Sir Archibald Napier, John Napier&rsquo;s father, in the
office of justice-depute. Between John Craig and John Napier a
friendship sprang up which may have been due to their common
taste for mathematics. There are extant three letters from
Dr John Craig to Tycho Brahe, which show that he was on the
most friendly terms with him. In the first letter, of which the
date is not given, Craig says that Sir William Stuart has safely
delivered to him, &ldquo;about the beginning of last winter,&rdquo; the book
which he sent him. Now Mark Napier found in the library of
the university of Edinburgh a mathematical work bearing a
sentence in Latin which he translates, &ldquo;To Doctor John Craig
of Edinburgh, in Scotland, a most illustrious man, highly gifted
with various and excellent learning, professor of medicine, and
exceedingly skilled in the mathematics, Tycho Brahe hath sent
this gift, and with his own hand written this at Uraniburg,
2d November 1588.&rdquo; As Sir William Stuart was sent to
Denmark to arrange the preliminaries of King James&rsquo;s marriage,
and returned to Edinburgh on the 15th of November 1588, it
would seem probable that this was the volume referred to by Craig.
It appears from Craig&rsquo;s letter, to which we may therefore assign
the date 1589, that, five years before, he had made an attempt to
reach Uranienburg, but had been baffled by the storms and rocks
of Norway, and that ever since then he had been longing to visit
Tycho. Now John Craig was physician to the king, and in 1590
James VI. spent some days at Uranienburg, before returning
to Scotland from his matrimonial expedition. It seems not
unlikely therefore that Craig may have accompanied the king
in his visit to Uranienburg.<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> In any case it is certain that
Craig was a friend and correspondent of Tycho&rsquo;s, and it is probable
that he was the &ldquo;Scotus quidam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We may infer therefore that as early as 1594 Napier had
communicated to some one, probably John Craig, his hope of
being able to effect a simplification in the processes of arithmetic.
Everything tends to show that the invention of logarithms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page873" id="page873"></a>873</span>
was the result of many years of labour and thought,<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> undertaken
with this special object, and it would seem that Napier had seen
some prospect of success nearly twenty years before the publication
of the <i>Descriptio</i>. It is very evident that no mere hint
with regard to the use of proportional numbers could have been
of any service to him, but it is possible that the news brought
by Craig of the difficulties placed in the progress of astronomy
by the labour of the calculations may have stimulated him to
persevere in his efforts.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;new invention in Denmark&rdquo; to which Anthony Wood
refers as having given the hint to Napier was probably the method
of calculation called prosthaphaeresis (often written in Greek
letters <span class="grk" title="prosthaphairesis">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#966;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), which had its origin in the solution of
spherical triangles.<a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The method consists in the use of the
formula</p>

<p class="center">sin a sin b = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> {cos (a &minus; b) &minus; cos (a + b)},</p>

<p class="noind">by means of which the multiplication of two sines is reduced to
the addition or subtraction of two tabular results taken from
a table of sines; and, as such products occur in the solution of
spherical triangles, the method affords the solution of spherical
triangles in certain cases by addition and subtraction only.
It seems to be due to Wittich of Breslau, who was assistant for
a short time to Tycho Brahe; and it was used by them in their
calculations in 1582. Wittich in 1584 made known at Cassel
the calculation of one case by this prosthaphaeresis; and
Justus Byrgius proved it in such a manner that from his proof
the extension to the solution of all triangles could be deduced.<a name="fa8a" id="fa8a" href="#ft8a"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
Clavius generalized the method in his treatise <i>De astrolabio</i> (1593),
lib. i. lemma liii. The lemma is enunciated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Quaestiones omnes, quae per sinus, tangentes, atque secantes
absolvi solent, per solam prosthaphaeresim, id est, per solam additionem,
subtractionem, sine laboriosa numerorum multiplicatione
divisioneque expedire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Clavius then refers to a work of Raymarus Ursus Dithmarsus
as containing an account of a particular case. The work is
probably the <i>Fundamentum astronomicum</i> (1588). Longomontanus,
in his <i>Astronomia Danica</i> (1622), gives an account of
the method, stating that it is not to be found in the writings
of the Arabs or Regiomontanus. As Longomontanus is mentioned
in Anthony Wood&rsquo;s anecdote, and as Wittich as well as
Longomontanus were assistants of Tycho, we may infer that
Wittich&rsquo;s prosthaphaeresis is the method referred to by Wood.</p>

<p>It is evident that Wittich&rsquo;s prosthaphaeresis could not be
a good method of practically effecting multiplications unless the
quantities to be multiplied were sines, on account of the labour
of the interpolations. It satisfies the condition, however, equally
with logarithms, of enabling multiplication to be performed
by the aid of a table of single entry; and, analytically considered,
it is not so different in principle from the logarithmic method.
In fact, if we put xy = &phi;(X + Y), X being a function of x only
and Y a function of y only, we can show that we must have
X = Ae<span class="sp">qx</span>, y = Be<span class="sp">qy</span>; and if we put xy = &phi;(X + Y) &minus; &phi;(X &minus; Y),
the solutions are &phi;(X + Y) = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>(x + y)<span class="sp">2</span>, and x = sin X, y = sin Y,
&phi;(X + Y) = &minus;<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> cos(X + Y). The former solution gives a method
known as that of quarter-squares; the latter gives the method
of prosthaphaeresis.</p>

<p>An account has now been given of Napier&rsquo;s invention and
its publication, the transition to decimal logarithms, the calculation
of the tables by Briggs, Vlacq and Gunter, as well as of
the claims of Byrgius and the method of prosthaphaeresis. To
complete the early history of logarithms it is necessary to return
to Napier&rsquo;s <i>Descriptio</i> in order to describe its reception on the
continent, and to mention the other logarithmic tables which were
published while Briggs was occupied with his calculations.</p>

<p>John Kepler, who has been already quoted in connexion with
Craig&rsquo;s visit to Tycho Brahe, received the invention of logarithms
almost as enthusiastically as Briggs. His first mention of the
subject occurs in a letter to Schikhart dated the 11th of March
1618, in which he writes-&ldquo;Extitit Scotus Baro, cujus nomen
mihi excidit, qui praeclari quid praestitit, necessitate omni
multiplicationum et divisionum in meras additiones et subtractiones
commutata, nec sinibus utitur; at tamen opus est
ipsi tangentium canone: et varietas, crebritas, difficultasque
additionum subtractionumque alicubi laborem multiplicandi
et dividendi superat.&rdquo; This erroneous estimate was formed
when he had seen the <i>Descriptio</i> but had not read it; and his
opinion was very different when he became acquainted with the
nature of logarithms. The dedication of his <i>Ephemeris</i> for 1620
consists of a letter to Napier dated the 28th of July 1619, and he
there congratulates him warmly on his invention and on the
benefit he has conferred upon astronomy generally and upon
Kepler&rsquo;s own Rudolphine tables. He says that, although
Napier&rsquo;s book had been published five years, he first saw it at
Prague two years before; he was then unable to read it, but last
year he had met with a little work by Benjamin Ursinus<a name="fa9a" id="fa9a" href="#ft9a"><span class="sp">9</span></a> containing
the substance of the method, and he at once recognized
the importance of what had been effected. He then explains
how he verified the canon, and so found that there were no
essential errors in it, although there were a few inaccuracies
near the beginning of the quadrant, and he proceeds, &ldquo;Haec
te obiter scire volui, ut quibus tu methodis incesseris, quas non
dubito et plurimas et ingeniosissimas tibi in promptu esse, eas
publici juris fieri, mihi saltem (puto et caeteris) scires fore gratissimum;
eoque percepto, tua promissa folio 57, in debitum
cecidisse intelligeres.&rdquo; This letter was written two years after
Napier&rsquo;s death (of which Kepler was unaware), and in the same
year as that in which the <i>Constructio</i> was published. In the
same year (1620) Napier&rsquo;s <i>Descriptio</i> (1614) and <i>Constructio</i>
(1619) were reprinted by Bartholomew Vincent at Lyons and
issued together.<a name="fa10a" id="fa10a" href="#ft10a"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>Napier calculated no logarithms of numbers, and, as already
stated, the logarithms invented by him were not to base <i>e</i>.
The first logarithms to the base e were published by John Speidell
in his <i>New Logarithmes</i> (London, 1619), which contains hyperbolic
log sines, tangents and secants for every minute of the
quadrant to 5 places of decimals.</p>

<p>In 1624 Benjamin Ursinus published at Cologne a canon of
logarithms exactly similar to Napier&rsquo;s in the <i>Descriptio</i> of 1614,
only much enlarged. The interval of the arguments is 10&Prime;,
and the results are given to 8 places; in Napier&rsquo;s canon the
interval is 1&prime;, and the number of places is 7. The logarithms are
strictly Napierian, and the arrangement is identical with that
in the canon of 1614. This is the largest Napierian canon that
has ever been published.</p>

<p>In the same year (1624) Kepler published at Marburg a table
of Napierian logarithms of sines with certain additional columns
to facilitate special calculations.</p>

<p>The first publication of Briggian logarithms on the continent
is due to Wingate, who published at Paris in 1625 his <i>Arithmétique

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page874" id="page874"></a>874</span>
numbers up to 1000, and log sines and tangents from Gunter&rsquo;s
<i>Canon</i> (1620). In the following year, 1626, Denis Henrion
published at Paris a <i>Traicté des Logarithmes</i>, containing Briggs&rsquo;s
logarithms of numbers up to 20,001 to 10 places, and Gunter&rsquo;s
log sines and tangents to 7 places for every minute. In the same
year de Decker also published at Gouda a work entitled <i>Nieuwe
Telkonst, inhoudende de Logarithmi voor de Ghetallen beginnende
van 1 tot 10,000</i>, which contained logarithms of numbers up to
10,000 to 10 places, taken from Briggs&rsquo;s <i>Arithmetica</i> of 1624, and
Gunter&rsquo;s log sines and tangents to 7 places for every minute.<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
Vlacq rendered assistance in the publication of this work, and
the privilege is made out to him.</p>

<p>The invention of logarithms and the calculation of the earlier
tables form a very striking episode in the history of exact science,
and, with the exception of the <i>Principia</i> of Newton, there is
no mathematical work published in the country which has produced
such important consequences, or to which so much interest
attaches as to Napier&rsquo;s <i>Descriptio</i>. The calculation of tables
of the natural trigonometrical functions may be said to have
formed the work of the last half of the 16th century, and the great
canon of natural sines for every 10 seconds to 15 places which
had been calculated by Rheticus was published by Pitiscus only
in 1613, the year before that in which the <i>Descriptio</i> appeared.
In the construction of the natural trigonometrical tables Great
Britain had taken no part, and it is remarkable that the discovery
of the principles and the formation of the tables that were to
revolutionize or supersede all the methods of calculation then
in use should have been so rapidly effected and developed in a
country in which so little attention had been previously devoted
to such questions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For more detailed information relating to Napier, Briggs and
Vlacq, and the invention of logarithms, the reader is referred to the
life of Briggs in Ward&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</i>
(London, 1740); Thomas Smith&rsquo;s <i>Vitae quorundam eruditissimorum
et illustrium virorum</i> (Vita Henrici Briggii) (London, 1707); Mark
Napier&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of John Napier</i> already referred to, and the same
author&rsquo;s <i>Naperi libri qui supersunt</i> (1839); Hutton&rsquo;s <i>History</i>; de
Morgan&rsquo;s article already referred to; Delambre&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;Astronomie
moderne</i>; the report on mathematical tables in the <i>Report of
the British Association</i> for 1873; and the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> for
October and December 1872 and May 1873. It may be remarked
that the date usually assigned to Briggs&rsquo;s first visit to Napier is 1616
and not 1615 as stated above, the reason being that Napier was
generally supposed to have died in 1618; but it was shown by Mark
Napier that the true date is 1617.</p>
</div>

<p>In the years 1791-1807 Francis Maseres published at London,
in six volumes quarto &ldquo;Scriptores Logarithmici, or a collection
of several curious tracts on the nature and construction of
logarithms, mentioned in Dr Hutton&rsquo;s historical introduction
to his new edition of Sherwin&rsquo;s mathematical tables ...,&rdquo;
which contains reprints of Napier&rsquo;s <i>Descriptio</i> of 1614, Kepler&rsquo;s
writings on logarithms (1624-1625), &amp;c. In 1889 a translation
of Napier&rsquo;s <i>Constructio</i> of 1619 was published by Walter Rae
Macdonald. Some valuable notes are added by the translator,
in one of which he shows the accuracy of the method employed
by Napier in his calculations, and explains the origin of a small
error which occurs in Napier&rsquo;s table. Appended to the Catalogue
is a full and careful bibliography of all Napier&rsquo;s writings, with
mention of the public libraries, British and foreign, which possess
copies of each. A facsimile reproduction of Bartholomew
Vincent&rsquo;s Lyons edition (1620) of the <i>Constructio</i> was issued in
1895 by A. Hermann at Paris (this imprint occurs on page 62
after the word &ldquo;Finis&rdquo;).</p>

<p>It now remains to notice briefly a few of the more important
events in the history of logarithmic tables subsequent to the
original calculations.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Common or Briggian Logarithms of Numbers.</i>&mdash;Nathaniel Roe&rsquo;s
<i>Tabulae logarithmicae</i> (1633) was the first complete seven-figure
table that was published. It contains seven-figure logarithms of
numbers from 1 to 100,000, with characteristics unseparated from the
mantissae, and was formed from Vlacq&rsquo;s table (1628) by leaving out
the last three figures. All the figures of the number are given at the
head of the columns, except the last two, which run down the
extreme columns&mdash;1 to 50 on the left-hand side, and 50 to 100 on the
right-hand side. The first four figures of the logarithms are printed
at the top of the columns. There is thus an advance half way towards
the arrangement now universal in seven-figure tables. The final step
was made by John Newton in his <i><span class="correction" title="amended from Trigononometria">Trigonometria</span> Britannica</i> (1658),
a work which is also noticeable as being the only extensive eight-figure
table that until recently had been published; it contains
logarithms of sines, &amp;c., as well as logarithms of numbers.</p>

<p>In 1705 appeared the original edition of Sherwin&rsquo;s tables, the
first of the series of ordinary seven-figure tables of logarithms of
numbers and trigonometrical functions such as are in general use
now. The work went through several editions during the 18th
century, and was at length superseded in 1785 by Hutton&rsquo;s tables,
which continued in successive editions to maintain their position
for a century.</p>

<p>In 1717 Abraham Sharp published in his <i>Geometry Improv&rsquo;d</i> the
Briggian logarithms of numbers from 1 to 100, and of primes from
100 to 1100, to 61 places; these were copied into the later editions
of Sherwin and other works.</p>

<p>In 1742 a seven-figure table was published in quarto form by
Gardiner, which is celebrated on account of its accuracy and of the
elegance of the printing. A French edition, which closely resembles
the original, was published at Avignon in 1770.</p>

<p>In 1783 appeared at Paris the first edition of François Callet&rsquo;s
tables, which correspond to those of Hutton in England. These
tables, which form perhaps the most complete and practically useful
collection of logarithms for the general computer that has been
published, passed through many editions.</p>

<p>In 1794 Vega published his <i>Thesaurus logarithmorum completus</i>,
a folio volume containing a reprint of the logarithms of numbers
from Vlacq&rsquo;s <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> of 1628, and <i>Trigonometria
artificialis</i> of 1633. The logarithms of numbers are arranged as in
an ordinary seven-figure table. In addition to the logarithms
reprinted from the <i>Trigonometria</i>, there are given logarithms for
every second of the first two degrees, which were the result of an
original calculation. Vega devoted great attention to the detection
and correction of the errors in Vlacq&rsquo;s work of 1628. Vega&rsquo;s <i>Thesaurus</i>
has been reproduced photographically by the Italian government.
Vega also published in 1797, in 2 vols. 8vo, a collection of logarithmic
and trigonometrical tables which has passed through many editions,
a very useful one volume stereotype edition having been published in
1840 by Hülsse. The tables in this work may be regarded as to some
extent supplementary to those in Callet.</p>

<p>If we consider only the logarithms of numbers, the main line of
descent from the original calculation of Briggs and Vlacq is Roe,
John Newton, Sherwin, Gardiner; there are then two branches,
viz. Hutton founded on Sherwin and Callet on Gardiner, and the
editions of Vega form a separate offshoot from the original tables.
Among the most useful and accessible of modern ordinary seven-figure
tables of logarithms of numbers and trigonometrical functions
may be mentioned those of Bremiker, Schrön and Bruhns. For
logarithms of numbers only perhaps Babbage&rsquo;s table is the most
convenient.<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>In 1871 Edward Sang published a seven-figure table of logarithms
of numbers from 20,000 to 200,000, the logarithms between 100,000
and 200,000 being the result of a new calculation. By beginning the
table at 20,000 instead of at 10,000 the differences are halved in
magnitude, while the number of them in a page is quartered. In this
table multiples of the differences, instead of proportional parts, are
given.<a name="fa13a" id="fa13a" href="#ft13a"><span class="sp">13</span></a> John Thomson of Greenock (1782-1855) made an independent
calculation of logarithms of numbers up to 120,000 to 12
places of decimals, and his table has been used to verify the errata
already found in Vlacq and Briggs by Lefort (see <i>Monthly Not. R.A.S.</i>
vol. 34, p. 447). A table of ten-figure logarithms of numbers up to
100,009 was calculated by W. W. Duffield and published in the
<i>Report of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1895-1896</i> as Appendix
12, pp. 395-722. The results were compared with Vega&rsquo;s <i>Thesaurus</i>
(1794) before publication.</p>

<p><i>Common or Briggian Logarithms of Trigonometrical Functions.</i>&mdash;The
next great advance on the Trigonometria artificialis took place
more than a century and a half afterwards, when Michael Taylor
published in 1792 his seven-decimal table of log sines and tangents
to every second of the quadrant; it was calculated by interpolation
from the <i>Trigonometria</i> to 10 places and then contracted to 7. On
account of the great size of this table, and for other reasons, it never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page875" id="page875"></a>875</span>
came into very general use, Bagay&rsquo;s <i>Nouvelles tables astronomiques</i>
(1829), which also contains log sines and tangents to every second,
being preferred; this latter work, which for many years was difficult
to procure, has been reprinted with the original title-page and date
unchanged. The only other logarithmic canon to every second that
has been published forms the second volume of Shortrede&rsquo;s <i>Logarithmic
Tables</i> (1849). In 1784 the French government decided that
new tables of sines, tangents, &amp;c., and their logarithms, should be
calculated in relation to the centesimal division of the quadrant.
Prony was charged with the direction of the work, and was expressly
required &ldquo;non seulement à composer des tables qui ne laissassent rien
à désirer quant à l&rsquo;exactitude, mais à en faire le monument de calcul
le plus vaste et le plus imposant qui eût jamais été exécuté ou même
conçu.&rdquo; Those engaged upon the work were divided into three
sections: the first consisted of five or six mathematicians, including
Legendre, who were engaged in the purely analytical work, or the
calculation of the fundamental numbers; the second section consisted
of seven or eight calculators possessing some mathematical
knowledge; and the third comprised seventy or eighty ordinary
computers. The work, which was performed wholly in duplicate,
and independently by two divisions of computers, occupied two years.
As a consequence of the double calculation, there are two manuscripts,
one deposited at the Observatory, and the other in the library of the
Institute, at Paris. Each of the two manuscripts consists essentially
of seventeen large folio volumes, the contents being as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The trigonometrical results are given for every hundred-thousandth
of the quadrant (10&Prime; centesimal or 3&Prime;.24 sexagesimal). The tables
were all calculated to 14 places, with the intention that only 12
should be published, but the twelfth figure is not to be relied upon.
The tables have never been published, and are generally known as the
<i>Tables du Cadastre</i>, or, in England, as the great French manuscript
tables.</p>

<p>A very full account of these tables, with an explanation of the
methods of calculation, formulae employed, &amp;c., was published by
Lefort in vol. iv. of the <i>Annales de l&rsquo;observatoire de Paris</i>. The printing
of the table of natural sines was once begun, and Lefort states
that he has seen six copies, all incomplete, although including the
last page. Babbage compared his table with the <i>Tables du Cadastre</i>,
and Lefort has given in his paper just referred to most important
lists of errors in Vlacq&rsquo;s and Briggs&rsquo;s logarithms of numbers which
were obtained by comparing the manuscript tables with those contained
in the <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> of 1624 and of 1628.</p>

<p>As the <i>Tables du Cadastre</i> remained unpublished, other tables
appeared in which the quadrant was divided centesimally, the most
important of these being Hobert and Ideler&rsquo;s <i>Nouvelles tables trigonométriques</i>
(1799), and Borda and Delambre&rsquo;s <i>Tables trigonométriques
décimales</i> (1800-1801), both of which are seven-figure tables. The
latter work, which was much used, being difficult to procure, and
greater accuracy being required, the French government in 1891
published an eight-figure centesimal table, for every ten seconds,
derived from the <i>Tables du Cadastre</i>.</p>

<p><i>Decimal or Briggian Antilogarithms.</i>&mdash;In the ordinary tables of
logarithms the natural numbers are all integers, while the logarithms
tabulated are incommensurable. In an antilogarithmic table, the
logarithms are exact quantities such as .00001, .00002, &amp;c., and the
numbers are incommensurable. The earliest and largest table of
this kind that has been constructed is Dodson&rsquo;s <i>Antilogarithmic canon</i>
(1742), which gives the numbers to 11 places, corresponding to the
logarithms from .00001 to .99999 at intervals of .00001. Antilogarithmic
tables are few in number, the only other extensive tables of
the same kind that have been published occurring in Shortrede&rsquo;s
<i>Logarithmic tables</i> already referred to, and in Filipowski&rsquo;s <i>Table of
antilogarithms</i> (1849). Both are similar to Dodson&rsquo;s tables, from
which they were derived, but they only give numbers to 7 places.</p>

<p><i>Hyperbolic or Napierian logarithms</i> (<i>i.e.</i> to base <i>e</i>).&mdash;The most
elaborate table of hyperbolic logarithms that exists is due to Wolfram,
a Dutch lieutenant of artillery. His table gives the logarithms of all
numbers up to 2200, and of primes (and also of a great many composite
numbers) from 2200 to 10,009, to 48 decimal places. The table
appeared in Schulze&rsquo;s <i>Neue und erweiterte Sammlung logarithmischer
Tafeln</i> (1778), and was reprinted in Vega&rsquo;s <i>Thesaurus</i> (1794), already
referred to. Six logarithms omitted in Schulze&rsquo;s work, and which
Wolfram had been prevented from computing by a serious illness,
were published subsequently, and the table as given by Vega is
complete. The largest hyperbolic table as regards range was
published by Zacharias Dase at Vienna in 1850 under the title <i>Tafel
der natürlichen Logarithmen der Zahlen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hyperbolic antilogarithms</i> are simple exponentials, <i>i.e.</i> the hyperbolic
antilogarithm of <i>x</i> is <i>e</i><span class="sp">x</span>. Such tables can scarcely be said to
come under the head of logarithmic tables. See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tables, Mathematical</a></span>:
<i>Exponential Functions</i>.</p>

<p><i>Logistic or Proportional Logarithms.</i>&mdash;The old name for what are
now called ratios or fractions are <i>logistic numbers</i>, so that a table of
log (a/x) where x is the argument and a a constant is called a table of
logistic or proportional logarithms; and since log (a/x) = log a &minus; log x
it is clear that the tabular results differ from those given in an ordinary
table of logarithms only by the subtraction of a constant and a
change of sign. The first table of this kind appeared in Kepler&rsquo;s
work of 1624 which has been already referred to. The object of a
table of log (a/x) is to facilitate the working out of proportions in
which the third term is a constant quantity a. In most collections
of tables of logarithms, and especially those intended for use in
connexion with navigation, there occurs a small table of logistic
logarithms in which a = 3600&Prime; (= 1° or 1<span class="sp">h</span>), the table giving log 3600 &minus; log x,
and x being expressed in minutes and seconds. It is also
common to find tables in which a = 10800&Prime; (= 3° or 3<span class="sp">h</span>), and x is expressed
in degrees (or hours), minutes and seconds. Such tables are
generally given to 4 or 5 places. The usual practice in books seems
to be to call logarithms logistic when a is 3600&Prime;, and proportional
when a has any other value.</p>

<p><i>Addition and Subtraction, or Gaussian Logarithms.</i>&mdash;<i>Gaussian
logarithms</i> are intended to facilitate the finding of the logarithms of
the sum and difference of two numbers whose logarithms are known,
the numbers themselves being unknown; and on this account they
are frequently called addition and subtraction logarithms. The
object of the table is in fact to give log (a ± b) by only one entry when
log a and log b are given. The utility of such logarithms was first
pointed out by Leonelli in a book entitled <i>Supplément logarithmique</i>,
printed at Bordeaux in the year XI. (1802/3); he calculated a
table to 14 places, but only a specimen of it which appeared in the
<i>Supplément</i> was printed. The first table that was actually published
is due to Gauss, and was printed in Zach&rsquo;s <i>Monatliche Correspondenz</i>,
xxvi. 498 (1812). Corresponding to the argument log x it gives
the values of log (1 + x<span class="sp">&minus;1</span>) and log (1 + x).</p>

<p><i>Dual Logarithms.</i>&mdash;This term was used by Oliver Byrne in a series
of works published between 1860 and 1870. Dual numbers and
logarithms depend upon the expression of a number as a product of
1.1, 1.01, 1.001 ... or of .9, .99, .999....</p>

<p>In the preceding <i>résumé</i> only those publications have been
mentioned which are of historic importance or interest.<a name="fa14a" id="fa14a" href="#ft14a"><span class="sp">14</span></a> For fuller
details with respect to some of these works, for an account of tables
published in the latter part of the 19th century, and for those which
would now be used in actual calculation, reference should be made
to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tables, Mathematical</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Calculation of Logarithms.</i>&mdash;The name logarithm is derived from
the words <span class="grk" title="logon arithmos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#969;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>, the number of the ratios, and the way of
regarding a logarithm which justifies the name may be explained as
follows. Suppose that the ratio of 10, or any other particular number,
to 1 is compounded of a very great number of equal ratios, as, for
example, 1,000,000, then it can be shown that the ratio of 2 to 1 is
very nearly equal to a ratio compounded of 301,030 of these small
ratios, or <i>ratiunculae</i>, that the ratio of 3 to 1 is very nearly equal
to a ratio compounded of 477,121 of them, and so on. The small
ratio, or <i>ratiuncula</i>, is in fact that of the millionth root of 10 to unity,
and if we denote it by the ratio of a to 1, then the ratio of 2 to 1 will
be nearly the same as that of a<span class="sp">301,030</span> to 1, and so on; or, in other
words, if a denotes the millionth root of 10, then 2 will be nearly
equal to a<span class="sp">301,030</span>, 3 will be nearly equal to a<span class="sp">477,121</span>, and so on.</p>

<p>Napier&rsquo;s original work, the <i>Descriptio Canonis</i> of 1614, contained,
not logarithms of numbers, but logarithms of sines, and the relations
between the sines and the logarithms were explained by the motions
of points in lines, in a manner not unlike that afterwards employed
by Newton in the method of fluxions. An account of the processes
by which Napier constructed his table was given in the <i>Constructio
Canonis</i> of 1619. These methods apply, however, specially to
Napier&rsquo;s own kind of logarithms, and are different from those actually
used by Briggs in the construction of the tables in the <i>Arithmetica
Logarithmica</i>, although some of the latter are the same in principle
as the processes described in an appendix to the <i>Constructio</i>.</p>

<p>The processes used by Briggs are explained by him in the preface
to the <i>Arithmetica Logarithmica</i> (1624). His method of finding the
logarithms of the small primes, which consists in taking a great
number of continued geometric means between unity and the given
primes, may be described as follows. He first formed the table of
numbers and their logarithms:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Numbers.</td> <td class="tcl">Logarithms,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">10</td> <td class="tcl">1</td></tr>

</table>

<p class="noind">each quantity in the left-hand column being the square root of the one
above it, and each quantity in the right-hand column being the half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page876" id="page876"></a>876</span>
of the one above it. To construct this table Briggs, using about
thirty places of decimals, extracted the square root of 10 fifty-four
times, and thus found that the logarithm of 1.00000 00000 00000
12781 91493 20032 35 was 0.00000 00000 00000 05551 11512 31257
82702, and that for numbers of this form (<i>i.e.</i> for numbers beginning
with 1 followed by fifteen ciphers, and then by seventeen or a less
number of significant figures) the logarithms were proportional to
these significant figures. He then by means of a simple proportion
deduced that log (1.00000 00000 00000 1) = 0.00000 00000 00000
04342 94481 90325 1804, so that, a quantity 1.00000 00000 00000 x
(where x consists of not more than seventeen figures) having been
obtained by repeated extraction of the square root of a given number,
the logarithm of 1.00000 00000 00000 x could then be found by
multiplying x by .00000 00000 00000 04342....</p>

<p>To find the logarithm of 2, Briggs raised it to the tenth power, viz.
1024, and extracted the square root of 1.024 forty-seven times, the
result being 1.00000 00000 00000 16851 60570 53949 77. Multiplying
the significant figures by 4342 ... he obtained the logarithm of this
quantity, viz. 0.00000 00000 00000 07318 55936 90623 9336, which
multiplied by 2<span class="sp">47</span> gave 0.01029 99566 39811 95265 277444, the
logarithm of 1.024, true to 17 or 18 places. Adding the characteristic
3, and dividing by 10, he found (since 2 is the tenth root of 1024)
log 2 = .30102 99956 63981 195. Briggs calculated in a similar
manner log 6, and thence deduced log 3.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the first process the value of the modulus
is in fact calculated from the formula.</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">

<p>Briggs also gave methods of forming the mean proportionals or
square roots by differences; and the general method of constructing
logarithmic tables by means of differences is due to him.</p>

<p>The following calculation of log 5 is given as an example of the
application of a method of mean proportionals. The process consists
in taking the geometric mean of numbers above and below 5, the
object being to at length arrive at 5.000000. To every geometric
mean in the column of numbers there corresponds the arithmetical
mean in the column of logarithms. The numbers are denoted by
A, B, C, &amp;c., in order to indicate their mode of formation.</p>

<p>Great attention was devoted to the methods of calculating
logarithms during the 17th and 18th centuries. The earlier methods
proposed were, like those of Briggs, purely arithmetical, and for a
long time logarithms were regarded from the point of view indicated
by their name, that is to say, as depending on the theory of compounded
ratios. The introduction of infinite series into mathematics
effected a great change in the modes of calculation and the treatment
of the subject. Besides Napier and Briggs, special reference should
be made to Kepler (<i>Chilias</i>, 1624) and Mercator (<i>Logarithmotechnia</i>,
1668), whose methods were arithmetical, and to Newton, Gregory,
Halley and Cotes, who employed series. A full and valuable account
of these methods is given in Hutton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Construction of Logarithms,&rdquo;
which occurs in the introduction to the early editions of his <i>Mathematical
Tables</i>, and also forms tract 21 of his <i>Mathematical Tracts</i>
(vol. i., 1812). Many of the early works on logarithms were reprinted
in the <i>Scriptores logarithmici</i> of Baron Maseres already
referred to.</p>

<p>In the following account only those formulae and methods
will be referred to which would now be used in the calculation of
logarithms.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page877" id="page877"></a>877</span>
Briggian logarithms of primes up to 1100, so that the logarithms
of all composite numbers whose greatest prime factor does not exceed
this number may be found by simple addition; and Wolfram&rsquo;s
table gives 48-decimal hyperbolic logarithms of primes up to 10,009.
By means of these tables and of a factor table we may very readily
obtain the Briggian logarithm of a number to 61 or a less number
of places or of its hyperbolic logarithm to 48 or a less number of
places in the following manner. Suppose the hyperbolic logarithm
of the prime number 43,867 required. Multiplying by 50, we have
50 × 43,867 = 2,193,350, and on looking in Burckhardt&rsquo;s <i>Table des

<p>The principle of the method is to multiply the given prime (supposed
to consist of 4, 5 or 6 figures) by such a factor that the product
may be a number within the range of the factor tables, and such that,
when it is increased by 1 or 2, the prime factors may all be within the
range of the logarithmic tables. The logarithm is then obtained by
use of the formula</p>

If the logarithm required is Briggian, the value of the series is to
be multiplied by M.</p>

<p>If the number is incommensurable or consists of more than seven
figures, we can take the first seven figures of it (or multiply and
divide the result by any factor, and take the first seven figures of
the result) and proceed as before. An application to the hyperbolic
logarithm of &pi; is given by Burckhardt in the introduction to his
<i>Table des diviseurs</i> for the second million.</p>

<p>The best general method of calculating logarithms consists, in its
simplest form, in resolving the number whose logarithm is required
into factors of the form 1 &minus; .1<span class="sp">r</span>n, where n is one of the nine digits;
and making use of subsidiary tables of logarithms of factors of this
form. For example, suppose the logarithm of 543839 required to
twelve places. Dividing by 10<span class="sp">5</span> and by 5 the number becomes
1.087678, and resolving this number into factors of the form 1 &minus; .1<span class="sp">r</span>n

of any number is a table of logarithms, to the required number of
places, of .n, .9n, .99n, .999n, &amp;c., for n = 1, 2, 3, ... 9.</p>

<p>The resolution of a number into factors of the above form is easily
performed. Taking, for example, the number 1.087678, the object is
to destroy the significant figure 8 in the second place of decimals;
this is effected by multiplying the number by 1-.08, that is, by
subtracting from the number eight times itself advanced two places,
and we thus obtain 1.00066376. To destroy the first 6 multiply
by 1 &minus; .0006 giving 1.000063361744, and multiplying successively
by 1 &minus; .00006 and 1 &minus; .000003, we obtain 1.000000357932, and it is
clear that these last six significant figures represent without any
further work the remaining factors required. In the corresponding
antilogarithmic process the number is expressed as a product of
factors of the form 1 + .1<span class="sp">n</span>x.</p>

<p>This method of calculating logarithms by the resolution of numbers
into factors of the form 1 &minus; .1<span class="sp">r</span>n is generally known as Weddle&rsquo;s
method, having been published by him in <i>The Mathematician</i> for
November 1845, and the corresponding method for antilogarithms
by means of factors of the form 1 + (.1)<span class="sp">r</span>n is known by the name of
Hearn, who published it in the same journal for 1847. In 1846 Peter
Gray constructed a new table to 12 places, in which the factors were
of the form 1 &minus; (.01)<span class="sp">r</span>n, so that n had the values 1, 2, ... 99; and
subsequently he constructed a similar table for factors of the form
1 + (.01)<span class="sp">r</span>n. He also devised a method of applying a table of Hearn&rsquo;s
form (<i>i.e.</i> of factors of the form 1 + .1<span class="sp">r</span>n) to the construction of
logarithms, and calculated a table of logarithms of factors of the form
1 + (.001)<span class="sp">r</span>n to 24 places. This was published in 1876 under the title
<i>Tables for the formation of logarithms and antilogarithms to twenty-four
or any less number of places</i>, and contains the most complete and
useful application of the method, with many improvements in points
of detail. Taking as an example the calculation of the Briggian
logarithm of the number 43,867, whose hyperbolic logarithm has
been calculated above, we multiply it by 3, giving 131,601, and find
by Gray&rsquo;s process that the factors of 1.31601 are</p>

<p>In Shortrede&rsquo;s <i>Tables</i> there are tables of logarithms and factors of
the form 1 ± (.01)<span class="sp">r</span> n to 16 places and of the form 1 ± (.1)<span class="sp">r</span> n to 25
places; and in his <i>Tables de Logarithmes à 27 Décimales</i> (Paris, 1867)
Fédor Thoman gives tables of logarithms of factors of the form
1 ± .1<span class="sp">r</span> n. In the <i>Messenger of Mathematics</i>, vol. iii. pp. 66-92, 1873,
Henry Wace gave a simple and clear account of both the logarithmic
and antilogarithmic processes, with tables of both Briggian and
hyperbolic logarithms of factors of the form 1 ± .1<span class="sp">r</span>n to 20 places.</p>

<p>Although the method is usually known by the names of Weddle
and Hearn, it is really, in its essential features, due to Briggs, who
gave in the <i>Arithmetica logarithmica</i> of 1624 a table of the logarithms
of 1 + .1<span class="sp">r</span>n up to r = 9 to 15 places of decimals. It was first formally
proposed as an independent method, with great improvements, by
Robert Flower in <i>The Radix</i>, <i>a new way of making Logarithms</i>, which
was published in 1771; and Leonelli, in his <i>Supplement logarithmique</i>
(1802-1803), already noticed, referred to Flower and reproduced
some of his tables. A complete bibliography of this method has been
given by A. J. Ellis in a paper &ldquo;on the potential radix as a means of
calculating logarithms,&rdquo; printed in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal
Society</i>, vol. xxxi., 1881, pp. 401-407, and vol. xxxii., 1881, pp. 377-379.
Reference should also be made to Hoppe&rsquo;s <i>Tafeln zur dreissigstelligen
logarithmischen Rechnung</i> (Leipzig, 1876), which give in a
somewhat modified form a table of the hyperbolic logarithm of
1 + .1<span class="sp">r</span>n.</p>

<p>The preceding methods are only appropriate for the calculation of
isolated logarithms. If a complete table had to be reconstructed, or
calculated to more places, it would undoubtedly be most convenient
to employ the method of differences. A full account of this method
as applied to the calculation of the <i>Tables du Cadastre</i> is given by
Lefort in vol. iv. of the <i>Annales de l&rsquo;Observatoire de Paris</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOGAU, FRIEDRICH,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> <span class="sc">Freiherr von</span> (1604-1655), German
epigrammatist, was born at Brockut, near Nimptsch, in Silesia,
in June 1604. He was educated at the gymnasium of Brieg and
subsequently studied law. He then entered the service of the
duke of Brieg. In 1644 he was made &ldquo;ducal councillor.&rdquo; He
died at Liegnitz on the 24th of July 1655. Logau&rsquo;s epigrams,
which appeared in two collections under the pseudonym &ldquo;Salomon
von Golaw&rdquo; (an anagram of his real name) in 1638 (<i>Erstes
Hundert Teutscher Reimensprüche</i>) and 1654 (<i>Deutscher Sinngedichte
drei Tausend</i>), show a marvellous range and variety of
expression. He had suffered bitterly under the adverse conditions
of the time; but his satire is not merely the outcome of
personal feeling. In the turbulent age of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War
he was one of the few men who preserved intact his intellectual
integrity and judged his contemporaries fairly. He satirized
with unsparing hand the court life, the useless bloodshed of the
war, the lack of national pride in the German people, and their
slavish imitation of the French in customs, dress and speech.
He belonged to the <i>Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft</i> under the name
<i>Der Verkleinernde</i>, and regarded himself as a follower of Martin
Opitz; but he did not allow such ties to influence his independence
or originality.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Logau&rsquo;s <i>Sinngedichte</i> were edited in 1759 by G. E. Lessing and
K. W. Ramler, who first drew attention to their merits; a second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page878" id="page878"></a>878</span>
edition appeared in 1791. A critical edition was published by G.
Eitner in 1872, who also edited a selection of Logau&rsquo;s epigrams for
the <i>Deutsche Dichter des XVII. Jahrhunderts</i> (vol. iii., 1870); there
is also a selection by H. Oesterley in Kürschner&rsquo;s <i>Deutsche Nationalliteratur</i>,
vol. xxviii. (1885). See H. Denker, <i>Beiträge zur literarischen

<p><span class="bold">LOGIA,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a title used to describe a collection of the sayings of
Jesus Christ (<span class="grk" title="logia Iêsou">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#945; &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</span>) and therefore generally applied to the
&ldquo;Sayings of Jesus&rdquo; discovered in Egypt by B. P. Grenfell and
A. S. Hunt. There is some question as to whether the term is
rightly used for this purpose. It does not occur in the Papyri
in this sense. Each &ldquo;saying&rdquo; is introduced by the phrase
&ldquo;Jesus says&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="legei">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span>) and the collection is described in the introductory
words of the 1903 series as <span class="grk" title="logoi">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span> not as <span class="grk" title="logia">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span>. Some
justification for the employment of the term is found in early
Christian literature. Several writers speak of the <span class="grk" title="logia tou kuriou">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span>
or <span class="grk" title="ta kuriaka logia">&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8048; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span>, <i>i.e.</i> oracles of (or concerning) the Lord. Polycarp,
for instance, speaks of &ldquo;those who pervert the oracles of
the Lord.&rdquo; (Philipp. 7), and Papias, as Eusebius tells us, wrote
a work with the title &ldquo;Expositions of the Oracles of the Lord.&rdquo;
The expression has been variously interpreted. It need mean no
more (Lightfoot, <i>Essays on Supernatural Religion</i>, 172 seq.) than
narratives of (or concerning) the Lord; on the other hand, the
phrase is capable of a much more definite meaning, and there are
many scholars who hold that it refers to a document which
contained a collection of the sayings of Jesus. Some such
document, we know, must lie at the base of our Synoptic Gospels,
and it is quite possible that it may have been known to and used
by Papias. It is only on this assumption that the use of the term
Logia in the sense described above can be justified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sayings,&rdquo; to which the term Logia is generally applied,
consist of (<i>a</i>) a papyrus leaf containing seven or eight sayings of
Jesus discovered in 1897, (<i>b</i>) a second leaf containing five more
sayings discovered in 1903, (<i>c</i>) two fragments of unknown
Gospels, the former published in 1903, the latter in 1907. All
these were found amongst the great mass of papyri acquired by
the Egyptian Exploration Fund from the ruins of Oxyrhynchus,
one of the chief early Christian centres in Egypt, situated some
120 m. S. of Cairo.</p>

<p>These documents have naturally excited considerable interest
and raised many questions. The papyri of the &ldquo;sayings&rdquo; date
from the 3rd century and most scholars agree that the &ldquo;sayings&rdquo;
themselves go back to the 2nd. The year <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 140 is generally
assigned as the <i>terminus ad quem</i>. The problem as to their
origin has been keenly discussed. There are two main types of
theory. (1) Some suppose that they are excerpts from an
uncanonical Gospel. (2) Others think that they represent an
independent and original collection of sayings. The first theory
has assumed three main forms. (<i>a</i>) Harnack maintains that they
were taken from the Gospel according to the Egyptians. This
theory, however, is based upon a hypothetical reconstruction
of the Gospel in question which has found very few supporters.
(<i>b</i>) Others have advocated the Gospel of the Hebrews as the
source of the &ldquo;sayings,&rdquo; on the ground of the resemblance
between the first &ldquo;saying&rdquo; of the 1903 series and a well-authenticated
fragment of that Gospel. The resemblance, however, is
not sufficiently clear to support the conclusion. (<i>c</i>) A third view
supposes that they are extracts from the Gospel of Thomas&mdash;an
apocryphal Gospel dealing with the boyhood of Jesus. Beyond
the allusion to Thomas in the introductory paragraph to the 1903
series, there seems to be no tangible evidence in support of this
view. The second theory, which maintains that the papyri
represent an independent collection of &ldquo;sayings,&rdquo; seems to be
the opinion which has found greatest favour. It has won the
support of W. Sanday, H. B. Swete, Rendel Harris, W. Lock,
Heinrici, &amp;c. There is a considerable diversity of judgment,
however, with regard to the value of the collection. (<i>a</i>) Some
scholars maintain that the collection goes back to the 1st century
and represents one of the earliest attempts to construct an
account of the teaching of Jesus. They are therefore disposed
to admit to a greater or less extent and with widely varying
degrees of confidence the presence of genuine elements in the new
matter. (<i>b</i>) Sanday and many others regard the sayings as
originating early in the 2nd century and think that, though not
&ldquo;directly dependent on the Canonical Gospels,&rdquo; they have
&ldquo;their origin under conditions of thought which these Gospels
had created.&rdquo; The &ldquo;sayings&rdquo; must be regarded as expansions
of the true tradition, and little value is therefore to be attached
to the new material.</p>

<p>With the knowledge at our disposal, it is impossible to reach an
assured conclusion between these two views. The real problem,
to which at present no solution has been found, is to account for
the new material in the &ldquo;sayings.&rdquo; There seems to be no motive
sufficient to explain the additions that have been made to the
text of the Gospels. It cannot be proved that the expansions have
been made in the interests of any sect or heresy. Unless new
discoveries provide the clue, or some reasonable explanation can
otherwise be found, there seems to be no reason why we should
not regard the &ldquo;sayings&rdquo; as containing material which ought
to be taken into account in the critical study of the teaching of
Jesus.</p>

<p>The 1903 Gospel fragment is so mutilated in many of its parts
that it is difficult to decide upon its character and value. It
appears to be earlier than 150, and to be taken from a Gospel
which followed more or less closely the version of the teaching of
Jesus given by Matthew and Luke. The phrase &ldquo;when ye shall
be stripped and not be ashamed&rdquo; contains an idea which has
some affinity with two passages found respectively in the Gospel
according to the Egyptians and the so-called Second Epistle of
Clement. The resemblance, however, is not sufficiently close to
warrant the deduction that either the Gospel of the Egyptians
or the Gospel from which the citation in 2 Clement is taken (if
these two are distinct) is the source from which our fragment is
derived.</p>

<p>The second Gospel fragment (1907) seems to be of later origin
than the documents already mentioned. Grenfell and Hunt
date the Gospel, from which it is an excerpt, about 200. There
is considerable difficulty with regard to some of the details.
The statement that an ordinary Jew was required to wash and
change his clothes before visiting the inner court of the temple
is quite unsupported by any other evidence. Nothing is known
about &ldquo;the place of purification&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="agneutêrion">&#7937;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) nor &ldquo;the pool
of David&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="limnê tou Daueid">&#955;&#943;&#956;&#957;&#951; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#916;&#945;&#965;&#949;&#943;&#948;</span>). Nor does the statement that
&ldquo;the sacred vessels&rdquo; were visible from the place where Jesus
was standing seem at all probable. Grenfell and Hunt conclude
therefore&mdash;&ldquo;So great indeed are the divergences between this
account and the extant and no doubt well-informed authorities
with regard to the topography and ritual of the Temple that it is
hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that much of the local
colour is due to the imagination of the author who was aiming
chiefly at dramatic effect and was not really well acquainted with
the Temple. But if the inaccuracy of the fragment in this
important respect is admitted the historical character of the
whole episode breaks down and it is probably to be regarded as an
apocryphal elaboration of Matt. xv. 1-20 and Mark vii. 1-23.&rdquo;</p>

given to one of the four main departments of philosophy, though
its sphere is very variously delimited. The present article is
divided into 1. <i>The Problems of Logic</i>, II. <i>History</i>.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">I. <i>The Problems of Logic.</i></p>

<p><i>Introduction.</i>&mdash;Logic is the science of the processes of inference,
what, then, is inference? It is that mental operation which
proceeds by combining two premises so as to cause a consequent
conclusion. Some suppose that we may infer from one premise
by a so-called &ldquo;immediate inference.&rdquo; But one premise can
only reproduce itself in another form, <i>e.g.</i> all men are some
animals; therefore some animals are men. It requires the combination
of at least two premises to infer a conclusion different
from both. There are as many kinds of inference as there are
different ways of combining premises, and in the main three
types:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Analogical Inference</i>, from particular to particular: <i>e.g.</i>
border-war between Thebes and Phocis is evil; border-war
between Thebes and Athens is similar to that between Thebes
and Phocis; therefore, border-war between Thebes and Athens
is evil.</p>

<p>2. <i>Inductive Inference</i>, from particular to universal: <i>e.g.</i>
border-war between Thebes and Phocis is evil; all border-war
is like that between Thebes and Phocis; therefore, all border-war
is evil.</p>

<p>3. <i>Deductive or Syllogistic Inference</i>, from universal to particular,
<i>e.g.</i> all border-war is evil; border-war between Thebes and
Athens is border-war; therefore border-war between Thebes
and Athens is evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page880" id="page880"></a>880</span></p>

<p>In each of these kinds of inference there are three mental
judgments capable of being expressed as above in three linguistic
propositions; and the two first are the premises which are
combined, while the third is the conclusion which is consequent
on their combination. Each proposition consists of two terms,
the subject and its predicate, united by the copula. Each inference
contains three terms. In syllogistic inference the subject
of the conclusion is the minor term, and its predicate the major
term, while between these two extremes the term common to
the two premises is the middle term, and the premise containing
the middle and major terms is the major premise, the premise
containing the middle and minor terms the minor premise.
Thus in the example of syllogism given above, &ldquo;border-war
between Thebes and Athens&rdquo; is the minor term, &ldquo;evil&rdquo; the
major term, and &ldquo;border-war&rdquo; the middle term. Using S for
minor, P for major and M for middle, and preserving these signs
for corresponding terms in analogical and inductive inferences,
we obtain the following formula of the three inferences:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The love of unity has often made logicians attempt to resolve
these three processes into one. But each process has a peculiarity
of its own; they are similar, not the same. Analogical
and inductive inference alike begin with a particular premise
containing one or more instances; but the former adds a particular
premise to draw a particular conclusion, the latter requires
a universal premise to draw a universal conclusion. A citizen
of Athens, who had known the evils of the border-war between
Thebes and Phocis, would readily perceive the analogy of a
similar war between Thebes and Athens, and conclude analogously
that it would be evil; but he would have to generalize
the similarity of all border-wars in order to draw the inductive
conclusion that all alike are evil. Induction and deduction differ
still more, and are in fact opposed, as one makes a particular
premise the evidence of a universal conclusion, the other makes
a universal premise evidence of a particular conclusion. Yet
they are alike in requiring the generalization of the universal
and the belief that there are classes which are whole numbers
of similars. On this point both differ from inference by analogy,
which proceeds entirely from particular premises to a particular
conclusion. Hence we may redivide inference into particular
inference by analogy and universal inference by induction and
deduction. Universal inference is what we call reasoning;
and its two species are very closely connected, because universal
conclusions of induction become universal premises of deduction.
Indeed, we often induce in order to deduce, ascending from particular
to universal and descending from universal to particular
in one act as it were; so that we may proceed either directly
from particular to particular by analogical inference, or indirectly
from particular through universal to particular by an inductive-deductive
inference which might be called &ldquo;perduction.&rdquo; On
the whole, then, analogical, inductive and deductive inferences
are not the same but three similar and closely connected processes.</p>

<p>The three processes of inference, though different from one
another, rest on a common principle of similarity of which each
is a different application. Analogical inference requires that one
particular is similar to another, induction that a whole number
or class is similar to its particular instances, deduction that each
particular is similar to the whole number or class. Not that these
inferences require us to believe, or assume, or premise or
formulate this principle either in general, or in its applied forms:
the premises are all that any inference needs the mind to assume.
The principle of similarity is used, not assumed by the inferring
mind, which in accordance with the similarity of things and the
parity of inference spontaneously concludes in the form
that similars are similarly determined (&ldquo;similia similibus
convenire&rdquo;). In applying this principle of similarity, each of
the three processes in its own way has to premise both that
something is somehow determined and that something is similar,
and by combining these premises to conclude that this is similarly
determined to that. Thus the very principle of inference by
similarity requires it to be a combination of premises in order to
draw a conclusion.</p>

<p>The three processes, as different applications of the principle
of similarity, consisting of different combinations of premises,
cause different degrees of cogency in their several conclusions.
Analogy hardly requires as much evidence as induction. Men
speculate about the analogy between Mars and the earth, and
infer that it is inhabited, without troubling about all the planets.
Induction has to consider more instances, and the similarity
of a whole number or class. Even so, however, it starts from
a particular premise which only contains many instances, and
leaves room to doubt the universality of its conclusions. But
deduction, starting from a premise about all the members of a
class, compels a conclusion about every and each of necessity.
One border-war may be similar to another, and the whole
number may be similar, without being similarly evil; but if all
alike are evil, each is evil of necessity. Deduction or syllogism
is superior to analogy and induction in combining premises so as
to involve or contain the conclusion. For this reason it has been
elevated by some logicians above all other inferences, and for
this very same reason attacked by others as no inference at all.
The truth is that, though the premises contain the conclusion,
neither premise alone contains it, and a man who knows both
but does not combine them does not draw the conclusion; it is
the synthesis of the two premises which at once contains the
conclusion and advances our knowledge; and as syllogism
consists, not indeed in the discovery, but essentially in the
synthesis of two premises, it is an inference and an advance
on each premise and on both taken separately. As again the
synthesis contains or involves the conclusion, syllogism has
the advantage of compelling assent to the consequences of the
premises. Inference in general is a combination of premises to
cause a conclusion; deduction is such a combination as to
compel a conclusion involved in the combination, and following
from the premises of necessity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, deduction or syllogism is not independent of
the other processes of inference. It is not the primary inference
of its own premises, but constantly converts analogical and
inductive conclusions into its particular and universal premises.
Of itself it causes a necessity of consequence, but only a
hypothetical necessity; if these premises are true, then this conclusion
necessarily follows. To eliminate this &ldquo;if&rdquo; ultimately
requires other inferences before deduction. Especially, induction
to universals is the warrant and measure of deduction from universals.
So far as it is inductively true that all border-war is
evil, it is deductively true that a given border-war is therefore
evil. Now, as an inductive combination of premises does not
necessarily involve the inductive conclusion, induction normally
leads, not to a necessary, but to a probable conclusion; and
whenever its probable conclusions become deductive premises,
the deduction only involves a probable conclusion. Can we
then infer any certainty at all? In order to answer this question
we must remember that there are many degrees of probability,
and that induction, and therefore deduction, draw conclusions
more or less probable, and rise to the point at which probability
becomes moral certainty, or that high degree of probability
which is sufficient to guide our lives, and even condemn murderers
to death. But can we rise still higher and infer real necessity?
This is a difficult question, which has received many answers.
Some noölogists suppose a mental power of forming necessary
principles of deduction a priori; but fail to show how we can
apply principles of mind to things beyond mind. Some empiricists,
on the other hand, suppose that induction only infers probable
conclusions which are premises of probable deductions; but
they give up all exact science. Between these extremes there is
room for a third theory, empirical yet providing a knowledge
of the really necessary. In some cases of induction concerned
with objects capable of abstraction and simplification, we have
a power of identification, by which, not a priori but in the act
of inducing a conclusion, we apprehend that the things signified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page881" id="page881"></a>881</span>
by its subject and predicate are one and the same thing which
cannot exist apart from itself. Thus by combined induction
and identification we apprehend that one and one are the same
as two, that there is no difference between a triangle and a
three-sided rectilineal figure, that a whole must be greater than
its part by being the whole, that inter-resisting bodies necessarily
force one another apart, otherwise they would not be inter-resisting
but occupy the same place at the same moment.
Necessary principles, discovered by this process of induction
and identification, become premises of deductive demonstration
to conclusions which are not only necessary consequents on the
premises, but also equally necessary in reality. Induction thus
is the source of deduction, of its truth, of its probability, of its
moral certainty; and induction, combined with identification,
is the origin of the necessary principles of demonstration or
deduction to necessary conclusions.</p>

<p>Analogical inference in its turn is as closely allied with induction.
Like induction, it starts from a particular premise, containing
one or more examples or instances; but, as it is easier to
infer a particular than a universal conclusion, it supplies particular
conclusions which in their turn become further particular
premises of induction. Its second premise is indeed merely a
particular apprehension that one particular is similar to another,
whereas the second premise of induction is a universal apprehension
that a whole number of particulars is similar to those from
which the inference starts; but at bottom these two apprehensions
of similarity are so alike as to suggest that the universal
premise of induction has arisen as a generalized analogy. It
seems likely that man has arrived at the apprehension of a whole
individual, <i>e.g.</i> a whole animal including all its parts, and thence
has inferred by analogy a whole number, or class, <i>e.g.</i> of animals
including all individual animals; and accordingly that the
particular analogy of one individual to another has given rise
to the general analogy of every to each individual in a class,
or whole number of individuals, contained in the second premise
of induction. In this case, analogical inference has led to
induction, as induction to deduction. Further, analogical
inference from particular to particular suggests inductive-deductive
inference from particular through universal to
particular.</p>

<p>Newton, according to Dr Pemberton, thought in 1666 that
the moon moves so like a falling body that it has a similar
centripetal force to the earth, 20 years before he demonstrated
this conclusion from the laws of motion in the <i>Principia</i>. In
fact, analogical, inductive and deductive inferences, though
different processes of combining premises to cause different
conclusions, are so similar and related, so united in principle
and interdependent, so consolidated into a system of inference,
that they cannot be completely investigated apart, but together
constitute a single subject of science. This science of inference
in general is logic.</p>

<p>Logic, however, did not begin as a science of all inference.
Rather it began as a science of reasoning (<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>), of syllogism
(<span class="grk" title="syllogismos">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>), of deductive inference. Aristotle was its founder.
He was anticipated of course by many generations of spontaneous
thinking (<i>logica naturalis</i>). Many of the higher animals infer
by analogy: otherwise we cannot explain their thinking. Man
so infers at first: otherwise we cannot explain the actions of
young children, who before they begin to speak give no evidence
of universal thinking. It is likely that man began with particular
inference and with particular language; and that, gradually
generalizing thought and language, he learnt at last to think
and say &ldquo;all,&rdquo; to infer universally, to induce and deduce, to
reason, in short, and raise himself above other animals. In
ancient times, and especially in Egypt, Babylon and Greece,
he went on to develop reason into science or the systematic
investigation of definite subjects, <i>e.g.</i> arithmetic of number,
geometry of magnitude, astronomy of stars, politics of government,
ethics of goods. In Greece he became more and more
reflective and conscious of himself, of his body and soul, his
manners and morals, his mental operations and especially his
reason. One of the characteristics of Greek philosophers is
their growing tendency, in investigating any subject, to turn
round and ask themselves what should be the method of investigation.
In this way the Presocratics and Sophists, and still more
Socrates and Plato, threw out hints on sense and reason, on
inferential processes and scientific methods which may be called
anticipations of logic. But Aristotle was the first to conceive
of reasoning itself as a definite subject of a special science,
which he called analytics or analytic science, specially designed to
analyse syllogism and especially demonstrative syllogism, or
science, and to be in fact a science of sciences. He was therefore
the founder of the science of logic.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among the Aristotelian treatises we have the following, which
together constitute this new science of reasoning:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>Categories</i>, or names signifying things which can become
predicates;</p>

<p>2. The <i>De Interpretatione</i>, or the enumeration of conceptions and
their combinations by (1) nouns and verbs (names), (2) enunciations
(propositions);</p>

<p>3. The <i>Prior Analytics</i>, on syllogism;</p>

<p>4. The <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, on demonstrative syllogism, or science;</p>

<p>5. The <i>Topics</i>, on dialectical syllogism; or argument;</p>

<p>6. The <i>Sophistical Elenchi</i>, on sophistical or contentious syllogism,
or sophistical fallacies.</p>

<p>So far as we know, Aristotle had no one name for all these investigations.
&ldquo;Analytics&rdquo; is only applied to the <i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior
Analytics</i>, and &ldquo;logical,&rdquo; which he opposed to &ldquo;analytical,&rdquo; only
suits the <i>Topics</i> and at most the <i>Sophistical Elenchi</i>; secondly,
while he analyzed syllogism into premises, major and minor, and
premises into terms, subject and predicate, he attempted no division
of the whole science; thirdly, he attempted no order and arrangement
of the treatises into a system of logic, but only of the <i>Analytics</i>,
<i>Topics</i> and <i>Sophistical Elenchi</i> into a system of syllogisms. Nevertheless,
when his followers had arranged the treatises into the
<i>Organon</i>, as they called it to express that it is an instrument of
science, then there gradually emerged a system of syllogistic logic,
arranged in the triple division&mdash;terms, propositions and syllogisms&mdash;which
has survived to this day as technical logic, and has been the
foundation of all other logics, even of those which aim at its destruction.</p>
</div>

<p>The main problem which Aristotle set before him was the
analysis of syllogism, which he defined as &ldquo;reasoning in which
certain things having been posited something different from
them of necessity follows by their being those things&rdquo; (<i>Prior
Analytics</i>, i. 1). What then did he mean by reasoning, or rather
by the Greek word <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> of which &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; is an approximate
rendering? It was meant (cf. <i>Post. An.</i> i. 10) to be both
internal, in the soul (<span class="grk" title="ho esô logos, en tê psychê">&#8001; &#7956;&#963;&#969; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;, &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8135;</span>), and external, in
language (<span class="grk" title="ho exo logos">&#8001; &#7956;&#958;&#969; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>): hence after Aristotle the Stoics
distinguished <span class="grk" title="logos endiathetos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="prophorikos">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>. It meant, then,
both reason and discourse of reason (cf. Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet</i>,
i. 2). On its mental side, as reason it meant combination of
thoughts. On its linguistic side, as discourse it was used for any
combination of names to form a phrase, such as the definition
&ldquo;rational animal,&rdquo; or a book, such as the <i>Iliad</i>. It had also the
mathematical meaning of <i>ratio</i>; and in its use for definition it
is sometimes transferred to essence as the object of definition,
and has a mixed meaning, which may be expressed by &ldquo;account.&rdquo;
In all its uses, however, the common meaning is combination.
When Aristotle called syllogism <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>, he meant that it is a
combination of premises involving a conclusion of necessity.
Moreover, he tended to confine the term <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> to syllogistic
inference. Not that he omitted other inferences (<span class="grk" title="pisteis">&#960;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>).
On the contrary, to him (cf. <i>Prior Analytics</i>, ii. 24) we owe the
triple distinction into inference from particular to particular
(<span class="grk" title="paradeigma">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>, example, or what we call &ldquo;analogy&rdquo;), inference
from particular to universal (<span class="grk" title="epagôgê">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#942;</span>, induction), and inference
from universal to particular (<span class="grk" title="syllogismos">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>, syllogism, or deduction).
But he thought that inferences other than syllogism are
imperfect; that analogical inference is rhetorical induction; and
that induction, through the necessary preliminary of syllogism
and the sole process of ascent from sense, memory and experience
to the principles of science, is itself neither reasoning nor science.
To be perfect he thought that all inference must be reduced to
syllogism of the first figure, which he regarded as the specially
scientific inference. Accordingly, the syllogism appeared to him
to be the rational process (<span class="grk" title="meta logou">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;</span>), and the demonstrative
syllogism from inductively discovered principles to be science
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page882" id="page882"></a>882</span>
(<span class="grk" title="epistêmê">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#956;&#951;</span>). Hence, without his saying it in so many words,
Aristotle&rsquo;s logic perforce became a logic of deductive reasoning,
or syllogism. As it happened this deductive tendency helped
the development of logic. The obscurer premises of analogy and
induction, together with the paucity of experience and the backward
state of physical science in Aristotle&rsquo;s time would have
baffled even his analytical genius. On the other hand, the
demonstrations of mathematical sciences of his time, and the
logical forms of deduction evinced in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues, provided
him with admirable examples of deduction, which is also the
inference most capable of analysis. Aristotle&rsquo;s analysis of the
syllogism showed man how to advance by combining his
thoughts in trains of deductive reasoning. Nevertheless, the
wider question remained for logic: what is the nature of all inference,
and the special form of each of its three main processes?</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As then the reasoning of the syllogism was the main problem of
Aristotle&rsquo;s logic, what was his analysis of it? In distinguishing
inner and outer reason, or reasoning and discourse, he added that
it is not to outer reason but to inner reason in the soul that demonstration
and syllogism are directed (<i>Post. An.</i> i. 10). One would
expect, then, an analysis of mental reasoning into mental judgments
(<span class="grk" title="kriseis">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>) as premises and conclusion. In point of fact, he analysed
it into premises, but then analysed a premise into terms, which he
divided into subject and predicate, with the addition of the copula
&ldquo;is&rdquo; or &ldquo;is not.&rdquo; This analysis, regarded as a whole and as it is
applied in the <i>Analytics</i> and in the other logical treatises, was
evidently intended as a linguistic analysis. So in the <i>Categories</i>,
he first divided things said (<span class="grk" title="ta legomena">&#964;&#8048; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span>) into uncombined and
combined, or names and propositions, and then divided the former
into categories; and in the <i>De interpretatione</i> he expressly excluded
mental conceptions and their combinations, and confined himself
to nouns and verbs and enunciations, or, as we should say, to names
and propositions. Aristotle apparently intended, or at all events
has given logicians in general the impression, that he intended to
analyse syllogism into propositions as premises, and premise into
names as terms. His logic therefore exhibits the curious paradox
of being an analysis of mental reasoning into linguistic elements.
The explanation is that outer speech is more obvious than inner
thought, and that grammar and poetic criticism, rhetoric and
dialectic preceded logic, and that out of those arts of language arose
the science of reasoning. The sophist Protagoras had distinguished
various kinds of sentences, and Plato had divided the sentence
into noun and verb, signifying a thing and the action of a thing.
Rhetoricians had enumerated various means of persuasion, some of
which are logical forms, <i>e.g.</i> probability and sign, example and
enthymeme. Among the dialecticians, Socrates had used inductive
arguments to obtain definitions as data of deductive arguments
against his opponents, and Plato had insisted on the processes of
ascending to and descending from an unconditional principle by the
power of giving and receiving argument. All these points about
speech, eloquence and argument between man and man were absorbed
into Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of reasoning, and in particular the
grammar of the sentence consisting of noun and verb caused the
logic of the proposition consisting of subject and predicate. At the
same time, Aristotle was well aware that the science of reasoning is
no art of language and must take up a different position towards
speech as the expression of thought. In the <i>Categories</i> he classified
names, not, however, as a grammarian by their structure, but
as a logician by their signification. In the <i>De interpretatione</i>,
having distinguished the enunciation, or proposition, from other
sentences as that in which there is truth or falsity, he relegated the
rest to rhetoric or poetry, and founded the logic of the proposition,
in which, however, he retained the grammatical analysis into
noun and verb. In the <i>Analytics</i> he took the final step of originating
the logical analysis of the proposition as premise into subject and
predicate as terms mediated by the copula, and analysed the
syllogism into these elements. Thus did he become the founder
of the logical but linguistic analysis of reasoning as discourse (<span class="grk" title="ho exô
logos">&#8001; &#7956;&#958;&#969; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>) into propositions and terms. Nevertheless, the deeper question
remained, what is the logical but mental analysis of reasoning
itself (<span class="grk" title="ho esô logos">&#8001; &#7956;&#963;&#969; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>) into its mental premises and conclusion?</p>
</div>

<p>Aristotle thus was the founder of logic as a science. But he
laid too much stress on reasoning as syllogism or deduction,
and on deductive science; and he laid too much stress on the
linguistic analysis of rational discourse into proposition and terms.
These two defects remain ingrained in technical logic to this day.
But in the course of the development of the science, logicians
have endeavoured to correct those defects, and have diverged
into two schools. Some have devoted themselves to induction
from sense and experience and widened logic till it has become
a general science of inference and scientific method. Others
have devoted themselves to the mental analysis of reasoning,
and have narrowed logic into a science of conception, judgment
and reasoning. The former belong to the school of empirical
logic, the latter to the school of conceptual and formal logic.
Both have started from points which Aristotle indicated without
developing them. But we shall find that his true descendants
are the empirical logicians.</p>

<p>Aristotle was the first of the empiricists. He consistently
maintained that sense is knowledge of particulars and the
origin of scientific knowledge of universals. In his view, sense
is a congenital form of judgment (<span class="grk" title="dynamis symphytos kritikê">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962; &#963;&#973;&#956;&#966;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>,
<i>Post. An.</i> ii. 19); a sensation of each of the five senses is always
true of its proper object; without sense there is no science;
sense is the origin of induction, which is the origin of deduction
and science. The <i>Analytics</i> end (<i>Post. An.</i> ii. 19) with a detailed
system of empiricism, according to which sense is the primary
knowledge of particulars, memory is the retention of a sensation,
experience is the sum of many memories, induction infers
universals, and intelligence is the true apprehension of the universal
principles of science, which is rational, deductive,
demonstrative, from empirical principles.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>This empirical groundwork of Aristotle&rsquo;s logic was accepted by
the Epicureans, who enunciated most distinctly the fundamental
doctrine that all sensations are true of their immediate objects,
and falsity begins with subsequent opinions, or what the moderns
call &ldquo;interpretation.&rdquo; Beneath deductive logic, in the logic of
Aristotle and the canonic of the Epicureans, there already lay the
basis of empirical logic: sensory experience is the origin of all
inference and science. It remained for Francis Bacon to develop
these beginnings into a new logic of induction. He did not indeed
accept the infallibility of sense or of any other operation unaided. He
thought, rather, that every operation becomes infallible by method.
Following Aristotle in this order&mdash;sense, memory, intellect&mdash;he
resolved the whole process of induction into three ministrations:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The ministration to sense, aided by observation and experiment.</p>

<p>2. The ministration to memory, aided by registering and arranging
the data, of observation and experiment in tables of instances of
agreement, difference and concomitant variations.</p>

<p>3. The ministration to intellect or reason, aided by the negative
elimination by means of contradictory instances of whatever in the
instances is not always present, absent and varying with the given
subject investigated, and finally by the positive inference that
whatever in the instances is always present, absent and varying
with the subject is its essential cause.</p>

<p>Bacon, like Aristotle, was anticipated in this or that point; but,
as Aristotle was the first to construct a system of deduction in the
syllogism and its three figures, so Bacon was the first to construct
a system of induction in three ministrations, in which the requisites
of induction, hitherto recognized only in sporadic hints, were combined
for the first time in one logic of induction. Bacon taught
men to labour in inferring from particular to universal, to lay as
much stress on induction as on deduction, and to think and speak
of inductive reasoning, inductive science, inductive logic. Moreover,
while Aristotle had the merit of discerning the triplicity of
inference, to Bacon we owe the merit of distinguishing the three
processes without reduction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="list">
<p>1. Inference from particular to particular by Experientia
Literata, in plano;</p>

<p>2. Inference from particular to universal by Inductio, ascendendo;</p>

<p>3. Inference from universal to particular by Syllogism, descendendo.</p>
</div>

<p>In short, the comprehensive genius of Bacon widened logic into
a general science of inference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as Aristotle over-emphasized deduction so
Bacon over-emphasized induction by contending that it is the
only process of discovering universals (<i>axiomata</i>), which deduction
only applies to particulars. J. S. Mill in his <i>Logic</i> pointed out this
defect, and without departing from Baconian principles remedied it
by quoting scientific examples, in which deduction, starting from
inductive principles, applies more general to less general universals,
<i>e.g.</i> when the more general law of gravitation is shown to include
the less general laws of planetary gravitation. Mill&rsquo;s logic has the
great merit of copiously exemplifying the principles of the variety
of method according to subject-matter. It teaches us that scientific
method is sometimes induction, sometimes deduction, and sometimes
the consilience of both, either by the inductive verification of
previous deductions, or by the deductive explanation of previous
inductions.</p>

<p>It is also most interesting to notice that Aristotle saw further
than Bacon in this direction. The founder of logic anticipated the
latest logic of science, when he recognized, not only the deduction
of mathematics, but also the experience of facts followed by deductive
explanations of their causes in physics.</p>
</div>

<p>The consilience of empirical and deductive processes was an
Aristotelian discovery, elaborated by Mill against Bacon. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page883" id="page883"></a>883</span>
the whole, however, Aristotle, Bacon and Mill, purged from
their errors, form one empirical school, gradually growing by
adapting itself to the advance of science; a school in which
Aristotle was most influenced by Greek deductive Mathematics,
Bacon by the rise of empirical physics at the Renaissance, and
Mill by the Newtonian combination of empirical facts and
mathematical principles in the <i>Principia</i>. From studying this
succession of empirical logicians, we cannot doubt that sense,
memory and experience are the real origin of inference, analogical,
inductive and deductive. The deepest problem of logic is the
relation of sense and inference. But we must first consider the
mental analysis of inference, and this brings us to conceptual and
formal logic.</p>

<p>Aristotle&rsquo;s logic has often been called formal logic; it was
really a technical logic of syllogism analysed into linguistic
elements, and of science rested on an empirical basis. At the
same time his psychology, though maintaining his empiricism,
contained some seeds of conceptual logic, and indirectly of
formal logic. Intellectual development, which according to
the logic of the <i>Analytics</i> consists of sense, memory, experience,
induction and intellect, according to the psychology of the
<i>De Anima</i> consists of sense, imagination and intellect, and one
division of intellect is into conception of the undivided and
combination of conceptions as one (<i>De An.</i> iii. 6). The <i>De
Interpretatione</i> opens with a reference to this psychological
distinction, implying that names represent conceptions, propositions
represent combinations of conceptions. But the same
passage relegates conceptions and their combinations to the
<i>De Anima</i>, and confines the <i>De Interpretatione</i> to names and
propositions in conformity with the linguistic analysis which
pervades the logical treatises of Aristotle, who neither brought
his psychological distinction between conceptions and their combinations
into his logic, nor advanced the combinations of conceptions
as a definition of judgment (<span class="grk" title="krisis">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), nor employed
the mental distinction between conceptions and judgments as an
analysis of inference, or reasoning, or syllogism: he was no conceptual
logician. The history of logic shows that the linguistic
distinction between terms and propositions was the sole analysis
of reasoning in the logical treatises of Aristotle; that the mental
distinction between conceptions (<span class="grk" title="ennoiai">&#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#953;</span>) and judgments (<span class="grk" title="axiômata">&#7936;&#958;&#953;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>
in a wide sense) was imported into logic by the Stoics; and that
this mental distinction became the logical analysis of reasoning
under the authority of St Thomas Aquinas. In his commentary
on the <i>De Interpretatione</i>, St Thomas, after citing from the
<i>De Anima</i> Aristotle&rsquo;s &ldquo;duplex operatio intellectus,&rdquo; said,
&ldquo;Additur autem et tertia operatio, scilicet ratiocinandi,&rdquo; and
concluded that, since logic is a rational science (<i>rationalis scientia</i>),
its consideration must be directed to all these operations of
reason. Hence arose conceptual logic; according to which
conception is a simple apprehension of an idea without belief
in being or not being, <i>e.g.</i> the idea of man or of running; judgment
is a combination of conceptions, adding being or not being,
<i>e.g.</i> man is running or not running; and reasoning is a combination
of judgments: conversely, there is a mental analysis
of reasoning into judgments, and judgment into conceptions,
beneath the linguistic analysis of rational discourse into propositions,
and propositions into terms. Logic, according to this
new school, which has by our time become an old school, has to
co-ordinate these three operations, direct them, and, beginning
with conceptions, combine conceptions into judgments, and
judgments into inference, which thus becomes a complex combination
of conceptions, or, in modern parlance, an extension
of our ideas. Conceptual logicians were, indeed, from the first
aware that sense supplies the data, and that judgment and
therefore inference contains belief that things are or are not.
But they held, and still hold that sensation and conception are
alike mere apprehensions, and that the belief that things are or
are not arises somehow after sensation and conception in judgment,
from which it passes into inference. At first, they were
more sanguine of extracting from these unpromising beginnings
some knowledge of things beyond ideas. But at length many
of them became formal logicians, who held that logic is the
investigation of formal thinking, or consistent conception,
judgment and reasoning; that it shows how we infer formal
truths of consistency without material truth of signifying things;
that, as the science of the form or process, it must entirely
abstract from the matter, or objects, of thought; and that it
does not tell us how we infer from experience. Thus has logic
drifted further and further from the real and empirical logic of
Aristotle the founder and Bacon the reformer of the science.</p>

<p>The great merit of conceptual logic was the demand for a
mental analysis of mental reasoning, and the direct analysis of
reasoning into judgments which are the sole premises and conclusions
of reasoning and of all mental inferences. Aristotle
had fallen into the paradox of resolving a mental act into verbal
elements. The Schoolmen, however, gradually came to realize
that the result to their logic was to make it a <i>sermocionalis
scientia</i>, and to their metaphysics the danger of nominalism. St
Thomas made a great advance by making logic throughout a
<i>rationalis scientia</i>; and logicians are now agreed that reasoning
consists of judgments, discourse of propositions. This distinction
is, moreover, vital to the whole logic of inference,
because we always think all the judgments of which our inference
consists, but seldom state all the propositions by which it is
expressed. We omit propositions, curtail them, and even
express a judgment by a single term, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;.
Hence the linguistic expression is not a true measure of inference;
and to say that an inference consists of two propositions causing
a third is not strictly true. But to say that it is two judgments
causing a third is always true, and the very essence of inference,
because we must think the two to conclude the third in &ldquo;the
sessions of sweet silent thought.&rdquo; Inference, in short, consists of
actual judgments capable of being expressed in propositions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Inference always consists of judgments. But judgment does not
always consist of conceptions. It is not a combination of conceptions;
it does not arise from conceptions, nor even at first require
conception. Sense is the origin of judgment. One who feels pained
or pleased, who feels hot or cold or resisting in touch, who tastes
the flavoured, who smells the odorous, who hears the sounding,
who sees the coloured, or is conscious, already believes that something
sensible exists before conception, before inference, and before
language; and his belief is true of the immediate object of sense,
the sensible thing, <i>e.g.</i> the hot felt in touch. But a belief in the
existence of something is a judgment and a categorical judgment
of existence. Sense, then, outer and inner, or sensation and consciousness,
is the origin of sensory judgments which are true categorical
beliefs in the existence of sensible things; and primary
judgments are such true categorical sensory beliefs that things
exist, and neither require conception nor are combinations of conceptions.
Again, since sense is the origin of memory and experience,
memorial and experiential judgments are categorical and existential
judgments, which so far as they report sensory judgments are
always true. Finally, since sense, memory and experience are the
origin of inference, primary inference is categorical and existential,
starting from sensory, memorial and experiential judgments as
premises, and proceeding to inferential judgments as conclusions,
which are categorical and existential, and are true, so far as they
depend on sense, memory and experience.</p>

<p>Sense, then, is the origin of judgment; and the consequence is
that primary judgments are true, categorical and existential
judgments of sense, and primary inferences are inferences from
categorical and existential premises to categorical and existential
conclusions, which are true so far as they arise from outer and
inner sense, and proceed to things similar to sensible things. All
other judgments and inferences about existing things, or ideas, or
names, whether categorical or hypothetical, are afterthoughts,
partly true and partly false.</p>

<p>Sense, then, because it involves a true belief in existence is fitted
to be the origin of judgment. Conception on the other hand is the
simple apprehension of an idea, particular or universal, but without
belief that anything is or is not, and therefore is unfitted to beget
judgment. Nor could a combination of conceptions make a difference
so fundamental as that between conceiving and believing. The
most that it could do would be to cause an ideal judgment, <i>e.g.</i> that
the idea of a centaur is the idea of a man-horse; and even here some
further origin is needed for the addition of the copula &ldquo;is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far from being a cause, conception is not even a condition of
all judgments; a sensation of hot is sufficient evidence that hot
exists, before the idea of hot is either present or wanted. Conception
is, however, a condition of a memorial judgment: in order to remember
being hot, we require an idea of hot. Memory, however,
is not that idea, but involves a judgment that there previously
existed the hot now represented by the idea, which is about the
sensible thing beyond the conceived idea; and the cause of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page884" id="page884"></a>884</span>
memorial judgment is past sense and present memory. So sense,
memory and experience, the sum of sense and memory, though
requiring conception, are the causes of the experiential judgment
that there exist and have existed many similar, sensible things, and
these sensory, memorial and experiential judgments about the
existence of past and present sensible things beyond conceived
ideas become the particular premises of primary inference. Starting
from them, inference is enabled to draw conclusions which are
inferential judgments about the existence of things similar to
sensible things beyond conceived ideas. In rising, however, from
particular to universal inference, induction, as we have seen, adds
to its particular premise, S is P, a universal premise, every M is
similar to S, in order to infer the universal conclusion, every M is P.
This universal premise requires a universal conception of a class or
whole number of similar particulars, as a condition. But the
premise is not that conception; it is a belief that there is a whole
number of particulars similar to those already experienced. The
generalization of a class is not, as the conceptual logic assumes, the
abstraction of a general idea, but an inference from the analogy
of a whole individual thing, <i>e.g.</i> a whole man, to a whole number
of similar individuals, <i>e.g.</i> the whole of men. The general idea of all
men or the combination that the idea of all men is similar to the
idea of particular men would not be enough; the universal premise
that all men in fact are similar to those who have died is required
to induce the universal conclusion that all men in fact die. Universal
inference thus requires particular and universal conceptions as its
condition; but, so far as it arises from sense, memory, experience,
and involves generalization, it consists of judgments which do not
consist of conceptions, but are beliefs in things existing beyond
conception. Inference then, so far as it starts from categorical and
existential premises, causes conclusions, or inferential judgments,
which require conceptions, but are categorical and existential judgments
beyond conception. Moreover, as it becomes more deductive,
and causes conclusions further from sensory experience,
these inferential judgments become causes of inferential conceptions.
For example, from the evidence of molar changes due to the
obvious parts of bodies, science first comes to believe in molecular
changes due to imperceptible particles, and then tries to conceive
the ideas of particles, molecules, atoms, electrons. The conceptual
logic supposes that conception always precedes judgment; but the
truth is that sensory judgment begins and inferential judgment
ends by preceding conception. The supposed triple order&mdash;conception,
judgment, reasoning&mdash;is defective and false. The real
order is sensation and sensory judgment, conception, memory and
memorial judgment, experience and experiential judgment, inference,
inferential judgment, inferential conception. This is not all:
inferential conceptions are inadequate, and finally fail. They are
often symbolical; that is, we conceive one thing only by another
like it, <i>e.g.</i> atoms by minute bodies not nearly small enough. Often
the symbol is not like. What idea can the physicist form of intraspatial
ether? What believer in God pretends to conceive Him as
He really is? We believe many things that we cannot conceive; as
Mill said, the inconceivable is not the incredible; and the point of
science is not what we can conceive but what we should believe on
evidence. Conception is the weakest, judgment the strongest power
of man&rsquo;s mind. Sense before conception is the original cause of
judgment; and inference from sense enables judgment to continue
after conception ceases. Finally, as there is judgment without
conception, so there is conception without judgment. We often say
&ldquo;I understand, but do not decide.&rdquo; But this suspension of judgment
is a highly refined act, unfitted to the beginning of thought.
Conception begins as a condition of memory, and after a long
continuous process of inference ends in mere ideation. The conceptual
logic has made the mistake of making ideation a stage in
thought prior to judgment.</p>

<p>It was natural enough that the originators of conceptual logic,
seeing that judgments can be expressed by propositions, and conceptions
by terms, should fall into the error of supposing that, as
propositions consist of terms, so judgments consist of conceptions,
and that there is a triple mental order&mdash;conception, judgment,
reasoning&mdash;parallel to the triple linguistic order&mdash;term, proposition,
discourse. They overlooked the fact that man thinks long before
he speaks, makes judgments which he does not express at all, or
expresses them by interjections, names and phrases, before he uses
regular propositions, and that he does not begin by conceiving and
naming, and then proceed to believing and proposing. Feeling and
sensation, involving believing or judging, come before conception
and language. As conceptions are not always present in judgment,
as they are only occasional conditions, and as they are unfitted to
cause beliefs or judgments, and especially judgments of existence,
and as judgments both precede conceptions in sense and continue
after them in inference, it follows that conceptions are not the
constituents of judgment, and judgment is not a combination of
conceptions. Is there then any analysis of judgment? Paradoxical
as it may sound, the truth seems to be that primary judgment,
beginning as it does with the simplest feeling and sensation, is not
a combination of two mental elements into one, but is a division
of one sensible thing into the thing itself and its existence and the
belief that it is determined as existing, <i>e.g.</i> that hot exists, cold
exists, the pained exists, the pleased exists. Such a judgment has
a cause, namely sense, but no mental elements. Afterwards come
judgments of complex sense, <i>e.g.</i> that the existing hot is burning or
becoming more or less hot, &amp;c. Thus there is a combination of
sensations causing the judgment; but the judgment is still a division
of the sensible thing into itself and its being, and a belief that it is
so determined. Afterwards follow judgments arising from more
complex causes, <i>e.g.</i> memory, experience, inference. But however
complicated these mental causes, there still remain these points
common to all judgment:&mdash;(1) The mental causes of judgment are
sense, memory, experience and inference; while conception is a
condition of some judgments. (2) A judgment is not a combination
either of its causes or of its conditions, <i>e.g.</i> it is not a combination
of sensations any more than of ideas. (3) A judgment is a unitary
mental act, dividing not itself but its object into the object itself
and itself as determined, and signifying that it is so determined.
(4) A primary judgment is a judgment that a sensible thing is
determined as existing; but later judgments are concerned with
either existing things, or with ideas, or with words, and signify that
they are determined in all sorts of ways. (5) When a judgment is
expressed by a proposition, the proposition expresses the results of
the division by two terms, subject and predicate, and by the copula
that what is signified by the subject is what is signified by the
predicate; and the proposition is a combination of the two terms;
<i>e.g.</i> border war is evil. (6) A complex judgment is a combination
of two judgments, and may be copulative, <i>e.g.</i> you and I are men,
or hypothetical, or disjunctive, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>Empirical logic, the logic of Aristotle and Bacon, is on the
right way. It is the business of the logician to find the causes
of the judgments which form the premises and the conclusions
of inference, reasoning and science. What knowledge do we get
by sense, memory and experience, the first mental causes of
judgment? What is judgment, and what its various kinds?
What is inference, how does it proceed by combining judgments
as premises to cause judgments as conclusions, and what are
its various kinds? How does inference draw conclusions more
or less probable up to moral certainty? How does it by the aid
of identification convert probable into necessary conclusions,
which become necessary principles of demonstration? How is
categorical succeeded by conditional inference? What is
scientific method as a system of inferences about definite subjects?
How does inference become the source of error and
fallacy? How does the whole process from sense to inference
discover the real truth of judgments, which are true so far as
they signify things known by sense, memory, experience and
inference? These are the fundamental questions of the science
of inference. Conceptual logic, on the other hand, is false from
the start. It is not the first business of logic to direct us how
to form conceptions signified by terms, because sense is a prior
cause of judgment and inference. It is not the second business of
logic to direct us how out of conceptions to form judgments
signified by propositions, because the real causes of judgments
are sense, memory, experience and inference. It is, however,
the main business of logic to direct us how out of judgments to
form inferences signified by discourse; and this is the one point
which conceptual logic has contributed to the science of inference.
But why spoil the further mental analysis of inference by supposing
that conceptions are constituents of judgment and
therefore of inference, which thus becomes merely a complex
combination of conceptions, an extension of ideas? The mistake
has been to convert three operations of mind into three processes
in a fixed order&mdash;conception, judgment, inference. Conception
and judgment are decisions: inference alone is a process,
from decisions to decision, from judgments to judgment. Sense,
not conception, is the origin of judgment. Inference is the
process which from judgments about sensible things proceeds to
judgments about things similar to sensible things. Though
some conceptions are its conditions and some judgments its
causes, inference itself in its conclusions causes many more
judgments and conceptions. Finally, inference is an extension,
not of ideas, but of beliefs, at first about existing things, afterwards
about ideas, and even about words; about anything
in short about which we think, in what is too fancifully called
&ldquo;the universe of discourse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Formal logic has arisen out of the narrowness of conceptual
logic. The science of inference no doubt has to deal primarily
with formal truth or the consistency of premises and conclusion.
But as all truth, real as well as formal, is consistent, formal rules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page885" id="page885"></a>885</span>
of consistency become real rules of truth, when the premises
are true and the consistent conclusion is therefore true. The
science of inference again rightly emphasizes the formal thinking
of the syllogism in which the combination of premises involves
the conclusion. But the combinations of premises in analogical
and inductive inference, although the combination does not
involve the conclusion, yet causes us to infer it, and in so similar
a way that the science of inference is not complete without
investigating all the combinations which characterize different
kinds of inference. The question of logic is how we infer in fact,
as well as perfectly; and we cannot understand inference unless
we consider inferences of probability of all kinds. Moreover,
the study of analogical and inductive inference is necessary to
that of the syllogism itself, because they discover the premises
of syllogism. The formal thinking of syllogism alone is merely
necessary consequence; but when its premises are necessary
principles, its conclusions are not only necessary consequents
but also necessary truths. Hence the manner in which induction
aided by identification discovers necessary principles must be
studied by the logician in order to decide when the syllogism
can really arrive at necessary conclusions. Again, the science
of inference has for its subject the form, or processes, of thought,
but not its matter or objects. But it does not follow that it can
investigate the former without the latter. Formal logicians say
that, if they had to consider the matter, they must either consider
all things, which would be impossible, or select some,
which would be arbitrary. But there is an intermediate alternative,
which is neither impossible nor arbitrary; namely, to
consider the general distinctions and principles of all things;
and without this general consideration of the matter the logician
cannot know the form of thought, which consists in drawing
inferences about things on these general principles. Lastly, the
science of inference is not indeed the science of sensation,
memory and experience, but at the same time it is the science
of using those mental operations as data of inference; and, if
logic does not show how analogical and inductive inferences
directly, and deductive inferences indirectly, arise from experience,
it becomes a science of mere thinking without knowledge.</p>

<p>Logic is related to all the sciences, because it considers the
common inferences and varying methods used in investigating
different subjects. But it is most closely related to the sciences
of metaphysics and psychology, which form with it a triad of
sciences. Metaphysics is the science of being in general, and
therefore of the things which become objects apprehended by
our minds. Psychology is the science of mind in general, and
therefore of the mental operations, of which inference is one.
Logic is the science of the processes of inference. These three
sciences, of the objects of mind, of the operations of mind,
of the processes used in the inferences of mind, are differently,
but closely related, so that they are constantly confused.
The real point is their interdependence, which is so
intimate that one sign of great philosophy is a consistent
metaphysics, psychology and logic. If the world of things
is <i>known</i> to be partly material and partly mental, then the
mind must have powers of sense and inference enabling it to
know these things, and there must be processes of inference
carrying us from and beyond the sensible to the insensible world
of matter and mind. If the whole world of things is matter,
operations and processes of mind are themselves material. If
the whole world of things is mind, operations and processes of
mind have only to recognize their like all the world over. It is
clear then that a man&rsquo;s metaphysics and psychology must colour
his logic. It is accordingly necessary to the logician to know
beforehand the general distinctions and principles of things in
metaphysics, and the mental operations of sense, conception,
memory and experience in psychology, so as to discover the
processes of inference from experience about things in logic.</p>

<p>The interdependence of this triad of sciences has sometimes
led to their confusion. Hegel, having identified being with
thought, merged metaphysics in logic. But he divided logic
into objective and subjective, and thus practically confessed
that there is one science of the objects and another of the processes
of thought. Psychologists, seeing that inference is a
mental operation, often extemporize a theory of inference to
the neglect of logic. But we have a double consciousness of
inference. We are conscious of it as one operation among
many, and of its omnipresence, so to speak, to all the rest.
But we are also conscious of the processes of the operation of
inference. To a certain extent this second consciousness
applies to other operations: for example, we are conscious of
the process of association by which various mental causes recall
ideas in the imagination. But how little does the psychologist
know about the association of ideas, compared with what the
logician has discovered about the processes of inference! The
fact is that our primary consciousness of all mental operations
is hardly equal to our secondary consciousness of the processes
of the one operation of inference from premises to conclusions
permeating long trains and pervading whole sciences. This elaborate
consciousness of inferential process is the justification of
logic as a distinct science, and is the first step in its method.
But it is not the whole method of logic, which also and rightly
considers the mental process necessary to language, without
substituting linguistic for mental distinctions.</p>

<p>Nor are consciousness and linguistic analysis all the instruments
of the logician. Logic has to consider the things we know, the
minds by which we know them from sense, memory and experience
to inference, and the sciences which systematize and
extend our knowledge of things; and having considered these
facts, the logician must make such a science of inference as will
explain the power and the poverty of human knowledge.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">General Tendencies of Modern Logic</span></p>

<p>There are several grounds for hope in the logic of our day.
In the first place, it tends to take up an intermediate position
between the extremes of Kant and Hegel. It does not, with the
former, regard logic as purely formal in the sense of abstracting
thought from being, nor does it follow the latter in amalgamating
metaphysics with logic by identifying being with thought.
Secondly, it does not content itself with the mere formulae of
thinking, but pushes forward to theories of method, knowledge
and science; and it is a hopeful sign to find this epistemological
spirit, to which England was accustomed by Mill, animating
German logicians such as Lotze, Dühring, Schuppe, Sigwart
and Wundt. Thirdly, there is a determination to reveal the
psychological basis of logical processes, and not merely to
describe them as they are in adult reasoning, but to explain
also how they arise from simpler mental operations and primarily
from sense. This attempt is connected with the psychological
turn given to recent philosophy by Wundt and others, and is
dangerous only so far as psychology itself is hypothetical.
Unfortunately, however, these merits are usually connected
with a less admirable characteristic&mdash;contempt for tradition,
Writing his preface to his second edition in 1888, Sigwart says:
&ldquo;Important works have appeared by Lotze, Schuppe, Wundt
and Bradley, to name only the most eminent; and all start
from the conception which has guided this attempt. That is,
logic is grounded by them, not upon an effete tradition but upon
a new investigation of thought as it actually is in its psychological
foundations, in its significance for knowledge, and its actual
operation in scientific methods.&rdquo; How strange! The spirit
of every one of the three reforms above enumerated is an unconscious
return to Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Organon</i>. Aristotle&rsquo;s was a logic
which steered, as Trendelenburg has shown, between Kantian
formalism and Hegelian metaphysics; it was a logic which in the
Analytics investigated the syllogism as a means to understanding
knowledge and science: it was a logic which, starting from
the psychological foundations of sense, memory and experience,
built up the logical structure of induction and deduction on the
profoundly Aristotelian principle that &ldquo;there is no process
from universals without induction, and none by induction
without sense.&rdquo; Wundt&rsquo;s comprehensive view that logic
looks backwards to psychology and forward to epistemology
was hundreds of years ago one of the many discoveries of
Aristotle.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Judgment</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Judgment and Conception.</i>&mdash;The emphasis now laid on
judgment, the recovery from Hume&rsquo;s confusion of beliefs with
ideas and the association of ideas, and the distinction of the
mental act of judging from its verbal expression in a proposition,
are all healthy signs in recent logic. The most fundamental
question, before proceeding to the investigation of inference,
is not what we say but what we think in making the judgments
which, whether we express them in propositions or not, are
both the premises and the conclusion of inference; and, as this
question has been diligently studied of late, but has been
variously answered, it will be well to give a list of the more
important theories of judgment as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>a</i>. It expresses a relation between the content of two ideas, not
a relation of these ideas (Lotze).</p>

<p><i>b</i>. It is consciousness concerning the objective validity of a
subjective combination of ideas, <i>i.e.</i> whether between the corresponding
objective elements an analogous combination exists
(Ueberweg).</p>

<p><i>c</i>. It is the synthesis of ideas into unity and consciousness of
their objective validity, not in the sense of agreement with external
reality but in the sense of the logical necessity of their synthesis
(Sigwart).</p>

<p><i>d</i>. It is the analysis of an aggregate idea (<i>Gesammtvorstellung</i>)
into subject and predicate; based on a previous association of
ideas, on relating and comparing, and on the apperceptive synthesis
of an aggregate idea in consequence; but itself consisting in an
apperceptive analysis of that aggregate idea; and requiring will
in the form of apperception or attention (Wundt).</p>

<p><i>e</i>. It requires an idea, because every object is conceived as well
as recognized or denied; but it is itself an assertion of actual fact,
every perception counts for a judgment, and every categorical is
changeable into an existential judgment without change of sense
(Brentano, who derives his theory from Mill except that he denies
the necessity of a combination of ideas, and reduces a categorical
to an existential judgment).</p>

<p><i>f</i>. It is a decision of the validity of an idea requiring will (Bergmann,
following Brentano).</p>

<p><i>g</i>. Judgment (<i>Urtheil</i>) expresses that two ideas belong together:
&ldquo;by-judgment&rdquo; (<i>Beurtheilung</i>) is the reaction of will expressing
the validity or invalidity of the combination of ideas (Windelband,
following Bergmann, but distinguishing the decision of validity
from the judgment).</p>

<p><i>h</i>. Judgment is consciousness of the identity or difference and
of the causal relations of the given; naming the actual combinations
of the data, but also requiring a priori categories of the understanding,
the notions of identity, difference and causality, as principles of
thought or laws, to combine the plurality of the given into a unity
(Schuppe).</p>

<p><i>i</i>. Judgment is the act which refers an ideal content recognized
as such to a reality beyond the act, predicating an idea of a reality,
a what of a that; so that the subject is reality and the predicate
the meaning of an idea, while the judgment refers the idea to reality
by an identity of content (Bradley and Bosanquet).</p>

<p><i>k</i>. Judgment is an assertion of reality, requiring comparison and
ideas which render it directly expressible in words (Hobhouse,
mainly following Bradley).</p>
</div>

<p>These theories are of varying value in proportion to their
proximity to Aristotle&rsquo;s point that predication is about things,
and to Mill&rsquo;s point that judgments and propositions are about
things, not about ideas. The essence of judgment is belief
that something is (or is not) determined, either as existing
(<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; &ldquo;A centaur is not&rdquo;) or as something in particular
(<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not a monkey&rdquo;). Neither Mill,
however, nor any of the later logicians whose theories we have
quoted, has been able quite to detach judgment from conception;
they all suppose that an idea, or ideas, is a condition of all
judgment. But judgment starts from sensation (<i>Empfindung</i>)
and feeling (<i>Gefühl</i>), and not from idea (<i>Vorstellung</i>). When
I feel pleased or pained, or when I use my senses to perceive a
pressure, a temperature, a flavour, an odour, a colour, a sound,
or when I am conscious of feeling and perceiving, I cannot
resist the belief that something sensible is present; and this
belief that something exists is already a judgment, a judgment
of existence, and, so far as it is limited to sense without inference,
a true judgment. It is a matter of words whether or not we
should call this sensory belief a judgment; but it is no matter
of choice to the logician, who regards all the constituents of
inference as judgments; for the fundamental constituents
are sensory beliefs, which are therefore judgments in the logical
sense. Sense is the evidence of inference; directly of analogical
and inductive, directly or indirectly of deductive, inference;
and therefore, if logic refuses to include sensory beliefs among
judgments, it will omit the fundamental constituents of inference,
inference will no longer consist of judgments but of sensory
beliefs plus judgments, and the second part of logic, the logic
of judgment, the purpose of which is to investigate the constituents
of inference, will be like <i>Hamlet</i> without the prince
of Denmark. If, on the other hand, all the constituents of
inference are judgments, there are judgments of sense; and
the evidence of the senses means that a judgment of sense is
true, while a judgment of inference is true so far as it is directly
or indirectly concluded from judgments of sense. Now a sensory
judgment, <i>e.g.</i> that a sensible pressure is existing, is explained
by none of the foregoing theories, because it requires nothing
but sensation and belief. It requires no will, but is usually
involuntary, for the stimulus forces one&rsquo;s attention, which is
not always voluntary; not all judgment then requires will, as
Wundt supposes. It requires no reference to reality beyond
the sensible pressure, because it is merely a belief that this
exists without inference of the external stimulus or any inference
at all: not all judgment then requires the reference of subjective
to objective supposed by Ueberweg, or the consciousness of
logical necessity supposed by Sigwart. It requires in addition
to the belief that something exists, no consideration as to whether
the belief itself be true, because a man who feels pressure believes
in the thing without further question about the belief: not all
judgment then requires a decision of validity, as Bergmann
supposes. It requires nothing beyond the sensation and belief
in the given existence of the given pressure: not all judgment
then requires categories of understanding, or notions of identity,
difference and causality, or even of existence, such as Schuppe
supposes. It requires no comparison in order to express it in
words, for a judgment need not be expressed, and a sensory
judgment of pressure is an irresistible belief that a real pressure
exists, without waiting for words, or for a comparison which
is wanted not to make a sensation a judgment, but to turn a
judgment into language: not all judgment then requires comparison
with a view to its expression, as supposed by Hobhouse.
Lastly, all the authors of the above-quoted theories err in
supposing that all judgment requires conception; for even
Mill thinks a combination of ideas necessary, and Brentano,
who comes still nearer to the nature of sensory judgment when
he says, &ldquo;Every perception counts for a judgment,&rdquo; yet thinks
that an idea is necessary at the same time in order to understand
the thing judged. In reality, the sensation and the belief are
sufficient; when I feel a sensible pressure, I cannot help believing
in its reality, and therefore judging that it is real, without any
<i>tertium quid</i>&mdash;an idea of pressure, or of existence or of pressure
existing&mdash;intervening between the sensation and the belief.
Only after sensation has ceased does an idea, or representation
of what is not presented, become necessary as a substitute for
a sensation and as a condition not of the first judgment that there
is, but of a second judgment that there was, something sensible.
Otherwise there would be no judgment of sensible fact, for the
first sensation would not give it, and the idea following the
sensation would be still farther off. The sensory judgment
then, which is nothing but a belief that at the moment of sense
something sensible exists, is a proof that not all judgment
requires conception, or synthesis or analysis of ideas, or decision
about the content, or about the validity, of ideas, or reference
of an ideal content to reality, as commonly, though variously,
supposed in the logic of our day.</p>

<p>Not, however, that all judgment is sensory: after the first
judgments of sense follow judgments of memory, and memory
requires ideas. Yet memory is not mere conception, as Aristotle,
and Mill after him, have perceived. To remember, we must
have a present idea; but we must also have a belief that the
thing, of which the idea is a representation, was (or was not)
determined; and this belief is the memorial judgment. Originally
such judgments arise from sensory judgments followed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page887" id="page887"></a>887</span>
ideas, and are judgments of memory after sense that something
sensible existed, <i>e.g.</i> pressure existed: afterwards come judgments
of memory after inference, <i>e.g.</i> Caesar was murdered.
Finally, most judgments are inferential. These are conclusions
which primarily are inferred from sensory and memorial judgments;
and so far as inference starts from sense of something
sensible in the present, and from memory after sense of something
sensible in the past, and concludes similar things, inferential
judgments are indirect beliefs in being and in existence beyond
ideas. When from the sensible pressures between the parts
of my mouth, which I feel and remember and judge that they
exist and have existed, I infer another similar pressure (<i>e.g.</i> of
the food which presses and is pressed by my mouth in eating),
the inferential judgment with which I conclude is a belief that
the latter exists as well as the former (<i>e.g.</i> the pressure of food
without as well as the sensible pressures within). Inference,
no doubt, is closely involved with conception. So far as it
depends on memory, an inferential judgment presupposes
memorial ideas in its data; and so far as it infers universal
classes and laws, it produces general ideas. But even so the
part played by conception is quite subordinate to that of belief.
In the first place, the remembered datum, from which an inference
of pressure starts, is not the conceived idea, but the belief
that the sensible pressure existed. Secondly, the conclusion
in which it ends is not the general idea of a class, but the belief
that a class, represented by a general idea, exists, and is (or is
not) otherwise determined (<i>e.g.</i> that things pressing and pressed
exist and move). Two things are certain about inferential
judgment: one, that when inference is based on sense and
memory, inferential judgment starts from a combination of
sensory and memorial judgment, both of which are beliefs that
things exist; the other, that in consequence inferential judgment
is a belief that similar things exist. There are thus three primary
judgments: judgments of sense, of memory after sense, and of
inference from sense. All these are beliefs in being and existence,
and this existential belief is first in sense, and afterwards transferred
to memory and inference. Moreover, it is transferred in
the same irresistible way: frequently we cannot help either
feeling pressure, or remembering it, or inferring it; and as there
are involuntary sensation and attention, so there are involuntary
memory and inference. Again, in a primary judgment existence
need not be expressed; but if expressed, it may be expressed
either by the predicate, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; or by the subject, <i>e.g.</i>
&ldquo;I who exist think.&rdquo; There are indeed differences between
primary judgments, in that the sensory is a belief in present,
the memorial in past, and the inferential in present, past and
future existence. But these differences in detail do not alter
the main point that all these are beliefs in the existing, in the
real as opposed to the ideal, in actual things which are not ideas.
In short, a primary judgment is a belief in something existing
apart from our idea of it; and not because we have an idea of it,
or by comparing an idea with, or referring an idea to, reality;
but because we have a sensation of it, or a memory of it or an
inference of it. Sensation, not conception, is the origin of
judgment.</p>

<p>2. <i>Different Significations of Being in different Kinds of
Judgment.</i>&mdash;As Aristotle remarked both in the <i>De Interpretatione</i>
and in the <i>Sophistici Elenchi</i>, &ldquo;not-being is thinkable&rdquo; does
not mean &ldquo;not-being exists.&rdquo; In the latter treatise he added
that it is a <i>fallacia a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter</i>
to argue from the former to the latter; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; as he says,
&ldquo;it is not the same thing to be something and to exist absolutely.&rdquo;
Without realizing their debt to tradition, Herbart, Mill and
recently Sigwart, have repeated Aristotle&rsquo;s separation of the
copula from the verb of existence, as if it were a modern discovery
that &ldquo;is&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;exists.&rdquo; It may be added that
they do not quite realize what the copula exactly signifies:
it does not signify existence, but it does signify a fact, namely,
that something is (or is not) determined, either absolutely in a
categorical judgment, or conditionally in a conditional judgment.
Now we have seen that all primary judgments signify more
than this fact; they are also beliefs in the existence of the thing
signified by the subject. But, in the first place, primary judgments
signify this existence never by the copula, but sometimes
by the predicate, and sometimes by the subject; and, secondly,
it does not follow that all judgments whatever signify existence.
Besides inference of existence there is inference of non-existence,
of things inconsistent with the objects of primary judgments.
Hence secondary judgments, which no longer contain a belief
that the thing exists, <i>e.g.</i> the judgment, &ldquo;not-being is thinkable,&rdquo;
cited by Aristotle; the judgment, &ldquo;A square circle is impossible,&rdquo;
cited by Herbart; the judgment, &ldquo;A centaur is a fiction of the
poets,&rdquo; cited by Mill. These secondary judgments of non-existence
are partly like and partly unlike primary judgments
of existence. They resemble them in that they are beliefs in
being signified by the copula. They are beliefs in things of a sort;
for, after all, ideas and names are things; their objects, even
though non-existent, are at all events things conceivable or
nameable; and therefore we are able to make judgments that
things, non-existent but conceivable or nameable, are (or are not)
determined in a particular manner. Thus the judgment about
a centaur is the belief, &ldquo;A conceivable centaur is a fiction of the
poets,&rdquo; and the judgment about a square circle is the belief,
&ldquo;A so-called square circle is an impossibility.&rdquo; But, though
beliefs that things of some sort are (or are not) determined,
these secondary judgments fall short of primary judgments of
existence. Whereas in a primary judgment there is a further
belief, signified by subject or predicate, that the thing is an
existing thing in the sense of being a real thing (<i>e.g.</i> a man),
different from the idea of it as well as from the name for it;
in a secondary judgment there is no further belief that the thing
has any existence beyond the idea (<i>e.g.</i> a centaur), or even
beyond the name (<i>e.g.</i> a square circle): though the idea or name
exists, there is no belief that anything represented by idea or
name exists. Starting, then, from this fundamental distinction
between judgments of existence and judgments of non-existence,
we may hope to steer our way between two extreme views
which emanate from two important thinkers, each of whom has
produced a flourishing school of psychological logic.</p>

<p>On the one hand, early in the 19th century Herbart started
the view that a categorical judgment is never a judgment of
existence, but always hypothetical; on the other hand, in the
latter part of the century Brentano started the view that all
categorical judgments are existential. The truth lies between
these contraries. The view of Herbart and his school is contradicted
by our primary judgments of and from sense, in which
we cannot help believing existence; and it gives an inadequate
account even of our secondary judgments in which we no longer
indeed believe existence, but do frequently believe that a non-existent
thing is (or is not) somehow determined unconditionally.
It is true, as Herbart says, that the judgment, &ldquo;A square circle
is an impossibility,&rdquo; does not contain the belief, &ldquo;A square
circle is existent&rdquo;; but when he goes on to argue that it means,
&ldquo;If a square circle is thought, the conception of impossibility
must be added in thought,&rdquo; he falls into a <i>non-sequitur</i>. To be
categorical, a judgment does not require a belief in existence,
but only that something, existent or not, is (or is not) determined;
and there are two quite different attitudes of mind even to a
non-existent thing, such as a square circle, namely, unconditional
and conditional belief. The judgment, &ldquo;A non-existent but
so-called square circle is an impossibility,&rdquo; is an unconditional,
or categorical judgment of non-existence, quite different from
any hypothetical judgment, which depends on the conditions
&ldquo;if it is thought,&rdquo; or &ldquo;if it exists,&rdquo; or any other &ldquo;if.&rdquo; On the
other hand, the view of Brentano and his school is contradicted
by these very categorical judgments of non-existence; and while
it applies only to categorical judgments of existence, it does
so inadequately. To begin with the latter objection, Brentano
proposed to change the four Aristotelian forms of judgment,
A, E, I, O, into the following existential forms:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. &ldquo;There is not an immortal man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>E. &ldquo;There is not a live stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;There is a sick man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O. &ldquo;There is an unlearned man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page888" id="page888"></a>888</span></p>

<p class="noind">This reconstruction, which merges subject and predicate in one
expression, in order to combine it with the verb of existence,
is repeated in similar proposals of recent English logicians.
Venn, in his <i>Symbolic Logic</i>, proposes the four forms, x<span class="ov">y</span> = 0,
xy = 0, xy &gt; 0, x<span class="ov">y</span> &gt; 0 (where <span class="ov">y</span> means &ldquo;not-y&rdquo;), but only as
alternative to the ordinary forms. Bradley says that &ldquo;&lsquo;S-P
is real&rsquo; attributes S-P, directly or indirectly, to the ultimate
reality,&rdquo; and agrees with Brentano that &ldquo;&rsquo;is&rsquo; never stands for
anything but &lsquo;exists&rsquo;&rdquo;; while Bosanquet, who follows Bradley,
goes so far as to define a categorical judgment as &ldquo;that which
affirms the existence of its subject, or, in other words, asserts
a fact.&rdquo; Now it is true that our primary judgments do contain
a belief in existence; but they do not all contain it in the same
way, but are beliefs sometimes that something is determined as
existing, and sometimes that something existing is particularly
determined. Brentano&rsquo;s forms do not express such a judgment
of existence, as &ldquo;All existing men are mortal&rdquo;: nor does
Bradley&rsquo;s form, &ldquo;Reality includes S-P.&rdquo; Metaphysically, all
realities are parts of one ultimate reality; but logically, even
philosophers think more often only of finite realities, existing
men, dogs, horses, &amp;c.; and children know that their parents
exist long before they apprehend ultimate reality. The normal
form, then, of a judgment of existence is either &ldquo;S is a real P,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;A real S is P.&rdquo; Hence the reconstruction of all categorical
judgments by merging subject and predicate, either on Brentano&rsquo;s
or on Bradley&rsquo;s plan, is a misrepresentation even of normal
categorical judgments of existence. Secondly, it is much more
a misrepresentation of categorical judgments of non-existence.
No existential form suits a judgment such as &ldquo;A centaur is a
fiction,&rdquo; when we do not believe that there is a centaur, or that
reality includes a centaur. As Mill pointed out, it cannot be
implied that a centaur exists, since the very thing asserted is
that the thing has no real existence. In a correspondence with
Mill, Brentano rejoined that the centaur exists in imagination;
Bradley says, &ldquo;inside our heads.&rdquo; According to one, then,
the judgment becomes &ldquo;There is an imaginary centaur&rdquo;;
according to the other &ldquo;Reality includes an imaginary centaur.&rdquo;
The rejoinder, however, though partly true, is not to the point.
The idea of the centaur does exist in our imagination, and inside
our heads, and the name of it in our mouths. But the point is
that the centaur conceived and named does not exist beyond the
idea of it and the name for it; it is not, like a man, a real thing
which is neither the idea of it nor the name for it. No amount of
subtlety will remove the difference between a categorical judgment
of existence, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;An existing man is mortal,&rdquo; and a
categorical judgment of non-existence, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;A conceivable
centaur is a fiction,&rdquo; because in the former we believe and mean
that the thing exists beyond the idea, and in the latter we do
not. If, contrary to usage, we choose to call the latter a judgment
of existence, there is no use in quarrelling about words;
but we must insist that new terms must in that case be invented
to express so fundamental a difference as that between judgments
about real men and judgments about ideal centaurs.
So long, however, as we use words in the natural sense, and call
the former judgments of existence, and the latter judgments of
non-existence, then &ldquo;is&rdquo; will not be, as Bradley supposes, the
same as &ldquo;exists,&rdquo; for we use &ldquo;is&rdquo; in both judgments, but
&ldquo;exists&rdquo; only in the first kind. Bosanquet&rsquo;s definition of a
categorical judgment contains a similar confusion. To assert
a fact and to affirm the existence of a subject are not, as he
makes out, the same thing: a judgment often asserts a fact and
denies existence in the same breath, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Jupiter is non-existent.&rdquo;
Here, as usual in logic, tradition is better than innovation.
All categorical judgment is an unconditional belief in the
fact, signified by the copula, that a thing of some sort is (or is
not) determined; but some categorical judgments are also
beliefs that the thing is an existing thing, signified either by the
subject or by the predicate, while others are not beliefs that the
thing exists at all, but are only beliefs in something conceivable,
or nameable, or in something or other, without particularizing
what. Judgment then always signifies being, but not always
existence.</p>

<p>3. <i>Particular and Universal Judgments.</i>&mdash;Aristotle, by distinguishing
affirmative and negative, particular and universal,
made the fourfold classification of judgments, A, E, I and O,
the foundation both of opposition and of inference. With regard
to inference, he remarked that a universal judgment means by
&ldquo;all,&rdquo; not every individual we know, but every individual
absolutely, so that, when it becomes a major premise, we know
therein every individual universally, not individually, and often
do not know a given individual individually until we add a
minor premise in a syllogism. Whereas, then, a particular
judgment is a belief that some, a universal judgment is a belief
that all, the individuals of a kind or total of similar individuals,
are similarly determined, whether they are known or unknown
individuals. Now, as we have already seen, what is signified by
the subject may be existing or not, and in either case a judgment
remains categorical so long as it is a belief without conditions.
Thus, &ldquo;Some existing men are poets,&rdquo; &ldquo;All existing men are
mortal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Some conceivable centaurs are human in their forequarters,&rdquo;
&ldquo;All conceivable centaurs are equine in their hindquarters,&rdquo;
are all categorical judgments, while the two first
are also categorical judgments of existence. Nevertheless these
obvious applications of Aristotelian traditions have been recently
challenged, especially by Sigwart, who holds in his <i>Logic</i> (secs.
27, 36) that, while a particular is a categorical judgment of
existence, a universal is hypothetical, on the ground that it
does not refer to a definite number of individuals, or to individuals
at all, but rather to general ideas, and that the appropriate
form of &ldquo;all M is P&rdquo; is &ldquo;if anything is M it is P.&rdquo; This
view, which has influenced not only German but also English
logicians, such as Venn, Bradley and Bosanquet, destroys the
fabric of inference, and reduces scientific laws to mere hypotheses.
In reality, however, particular and universal judgments are too
closely connected to have such different imports. In opposition,
a categorical particular is the contradictory of a universal,
which is also categorical, not hypothetical, <i>e.g.</i>, &ldquo;not all M is P&rdquo;
is the contradictory of &ldquo;all M is P,&rdquo; not of &ldquo;if anything is M it is
P.&rdquo; In inference, a particular is an example of a universal which
in its turn may become a particular example of a higher universal.
For instance, in the history of mechanics it was first inferred
from some that all terrestrial bodies gravitate, and then from
these as some that all ponderable bodies, terrestrial and celestial,
gravitate. How absurd to suppose that here we pass from a
particular categorical to a universal hypothetical, and then treat
this very conclusion as a particular categorical to pass to a higher
universal hypothetical! Sigwart, indeed, is deceived both about
particulars and universals. On the one hand, some particulars
are not judgments of existence, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;some imaginary deities
are goddesses&rdquo;; on the other hand, some universals are not
judgments of non-existence, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;every existing man is mortal.&rdquo;
Neither kind is always a judgment of existence, but each is sometimes
the one and sometimes the other. In no case is a universal
hypothetical, unless we think it under a condition; for in a
universal judgment about the non-existing, <i>e.g.</i> about all conceivable
centaurs, we do not think, &ldquo;If anything is a centaur,&rdquo;
because we do not believe that there are any; and in a universal
judgment about the existent, <i>e.g.</i> about all existing men, we do
not think, &ldquo;If anything is a man,&rdquo; because we believe that there
is a whole class of men existing at different times and places.
The cause of Sigwart&rsquo;s error is his misconception of &ldquo;all.&rdquo; So
far as he follows Aristotle in saying that &ldquo;all&rdquo; does not mean
a definite number of individuals he is right; but when he says
that we mean no individuals at all he deserts Aristotle and goes
wrong. By &ldquo;all&rdquo; we mean every individual whatever of a kind;
and when from the experience of sense and memory we start
with particular judgments of existence, and infer universal
judgments of existence and scientific laws, we further mean those
existing individuals which we have experienced, and every
individual whatever of the kind which exists. We mean neither
a definite number of individuals, nor yet an infinite number, but
an incalculable number, whether experienced or inferred to
exist. We do not mean existing here and now, nor yet out of
time and place, but at any time and place (<i>semper et ubique</i>)&mdash;past,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page889" id="page889"></a>889</span>
present and future being treated as simply existing, by
what logicians used to call <i>suppositio naturalis</i>. We mean then
by &ldquo;all existing&rdquo; every similar individual whatever, whenever,
and wherever existing. Hence Sigwart is right in saying that
&ldquo;All bodies are extended&rdquo; means &ldquo;Whatever is a body is
extended,&rdquo; but wrong in identifying this form with &ldquo;If anything
is a body it is extended.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whatever&rdquo; is not &ldquo;if anything.&rdquo;
For the same reason it is erroneous to confuse &ldquo;all existing&rdquo;
with a general idea. Nor does the use of abstract ideas and
terms make any difference. When Bosanquet says that in
&ldquo;Heat is a mode of motion&rdquo; there is no reference to individual
objects, but &ldquo;a pure hypothetical form which absolutely
neglects the existence of objects,&rdquo; he falls far short of expressing
the nature of this scientific judgment, for in his <i>Theory of Heat</i>
Clerk Maxwell describes it as &ldquo;believing heat as it exists in a
hot body to be in the form of kinetic energy.&rdquo; As Bacon would
say, it is a belief that all individual bodies <i>qua</i> hot are individually
but similarly moving in their particles. When, again, Bradley
and Bosanquet speak of the universal as if it always meant one
ideal content referred to reality, they forget that in universal
judgments of existence, such as &ldquo;All men existing are mortal,&rdquo;
we believe that every individually existing man dies his own
death individually, though similarly to other men; and that we
are thinking neither of ideas nor of reality; but of all existent
individual men being individually but similarly determined. A
universal is indeed one whole; but it is one whole of many
similars, which are not the same with one another. This is
indeed the very essence of distribution, that a universal is
predicable, not singly or collectively, but severally and similarly of
each and every individual of a kind, or total of similar individuals.
So also the essence of a universal judgment is that every individual
of the kind is severally but similarly determined.
Finally, a universal judgment is often existential; but whether
it is so or not it remains categorical, so long as it introduces no
hypothetical antecedent about the existence of the thing signified
by the subject. It is true that even in universal judgments of
existence there is often a hypothetical element; for example,
&ldquo;All men are mortal&rdquo; contains a doubt whether every man
whatever, whenever and wherever existing, must die. But this
is only a doubt whether all the things signified by the subject are
similarly determined as signified by the predicate, and not a
doubt whether there are such things at all. Hence the hypothetical
element is not a hypothetical antecedent &ldquo;If anything
is a man,&rdquo; but an uncertain conclusion that &ldquo;All existing men
are mortal.&rdquo; In other words, a categorical universal is often
problematic, but a problematic is not the same as a hypothetical
judgment.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Judgment and the Proposition.</i>&mdash;Judgment in general
is the mental act of believing that something is (or is not) determined.
A proposition is the consequent verbal expression of
such a belief, and consists in asserting that the thing as signified
by the subject is (or is not) determined as signified by the predicate.
But the expression is not necessary. Sensation irresistibly
produces a judgment of existence without needing
language. Children think long before they speak; and indeed,
as mere vocal sounds are not speech, and as the apprehension that
a word signifies a thing is a judgment, judgment is originally not
an effect, but a cause of significant language. At any rate, even
when we have learnt to speak, we do not express all we think, as
we may see not only from the fewness of words known to a child,
but also from our own adult consciousness. The principle of
thought is to judge enough to conclude. The principle of
language is to speak only so far as to understand and be understood.
Hence speech is only a curtailed expression of thought.
Sometimes we express a whole judgment by one word, <i>e.g.</i>
&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; or by a phrase, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;What a fire!&rdquo; and only usually
by a proposition. But even the normal proposition in the syllogistic
form <i>tertii adjacentis</i>, with subject, predicate and copula,
is seldom a complete expression of the judgment. The consequence
is that the proposition, being different from a judgment arising
after a judgment, and remaining an imperfect copy of judgment,
is only a superficial evidence of its real nature. Fortunately,
we have more profound evidences, and at least three evidences in
all: the linguistic expression of belief in the proposition; the
consciousness of what we mentally believe; and the analysis of
reasoning, which shows what we must believe, and have believed,
as data for inference. In these ways we find that a judgment
is both different from, and more than, a proposition. But recent
logicians, although they perceive the difference, nevertheless tend
to make the proposition the measure of the judgment. This
makes them omit sensory judgments, and count only those
which require ideas, and even general ideas expressed in general
terms. Sigwart, for example, gives as instances of our most
elementary judgments, &ldquo;This is Socrates,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is snow&rdquo;&mdash;beliefs
in things existing beyond ourselves which require considerable
inferences from many previous judgments of sense and
memory. Worse still, logicians seem unable to keep the judgment
apart from the proposition. Herbart says that the judgment
&ldquo;A is B&rdquo; does not contain the usually added thought that A is,
because there is no statement of A&rsquo;s existence; as if the statement
mattered to the thought. So Sigwart, in order to reduce
universals to hypotheticals, while admitting that existence is
usually thought, argues that it is not stated in the universal
judgment; so also Bosanquet. But in the judgment the point
is not what we state, but what we think; and so long as the
existence of A is added in thought, the judgment in question
must contain the thought that A exists as well as that A is B,
and therefore is a judgment that something is determined both
as existing and in a particular manner. The statement only
affects the proposition; and whenever we believe the existence
of the thing, the belief in existence is part of the judgment
thought, whether it is part of the proposition stated or not.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Here Sir William Hamilton did a real service to logic in pointing
out that &ldquo;Logic postulates to be allowed to state explicitly in
language all that is implicitly contained in the thought.&rdquo; Not that
men should or can carry this logical postulate out in ordinary life;
but it is necessary in the logical analysis of judgments, and yet
logicians neglect it. This is why they confuse the categorical and
the universal with the hypothetical. Taking the carelessly expressed
propositions of ordinary life, they do not perceive that
similar judgments are often differently expressed, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I, being a
man, am mortal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If I am a man, I am mortal&rdquo;; and conversely,
that different judgments are often similarly expressed.
In ordinary life we may say, &ldquo;All men are mortal,&rdquo; &ldquo;All centaurs
are figments,&rdquo; &ldquo;All square circles are impossibilities,&rdquo; &ldquo;All candidates
arriving five minutes late are fined&rdquo; (the last proposition
being an example of the identification of categorical with hypothetical
in Keynes&rsquo;s <i>Formal Logic</i>). But of these universal propositions
the first imperfectly expresses a categorical belief in existing things,
the second in thinkable things, and the third in nameable things,
while the fourth is a slipshod categorical expression of the hypothetical
belief, &ldquo;If any candidates arrive late they are fined.&rdquo; The
four judgments are different, and therefore logically the propositions
fully expressing them are also different. The judgment, then, is
the measure of the proposition, not the proposition the measure of
the judgment. On the other hand, we may go too far in the opposite
direction, as Hamilton did in proposing the universal quantification
of the predicate. If the quantity of the predicate were always
thought, it ought logically to be always stated. But we only sometimes
think it. Usually we leave the predicate indefinite, because,
as long as the thing in question is (or is not) determined, it does
not matter about other things, and it is vain for us to try to think
all things at once. It is remarkable that in <i>Barbara</i>, and therefore
in many scientific deductions, to think the quantity of the predicate
is not to the point either in the premises or in the conclusion; so
that to quantify the propositions, as Hamilton proposes, would
be to express more than a rational man thinks and judges. In
judgments, and therefore in propositions, indefinite predicates
are the rule, quantified predicates the exception. Consequently,
A E I O are the normal propositions with indefinite predicates;
whereas propositions with quantified predicates are only occasional
forms, which we should use whenever we require to think the
quantity of the predicate, <i>e.g.</i> (1) in conversion, when we must think
that all men are some animals, in order to judge that some animals
are men; (2) in syllogisms of the 3rd figure, when the predicate
of the minor premise must be particularly quantified in thought
in order to become the particularly quantified subject of the conclusion;
(3) in identical propositions including definitions, where
we must think both that 1 + 1 are 2 and 2 are 1 + 1. But the
normal judgment, and therefore the normal proposition, do not
require the quantity of the predicate. It follows also that the
normal judgment is not an equation. The symbol of equality (=)
is not the same as the copula (is); it means &ldquo;is equal to,&rdquo; where
&ldquo;equal to&rdquo; is part of the predicate, leaving &ldquo;is&rdquo; as the copula.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page890" id="page890"></a>890</span>
Now, in all judgment we think &ldquo;is,&rdquo; but in few judgments predicate
&ldquo;equal to.&rdquo; In quantitative judgments we may think x = y, or,
as Boole proposes, x = vy = (0/0)y or, as Jevons proposes, x = xy, or, as
Venn proposes, x which is not y = 0; and equational symbolic logic
is useful whenever we think in this quantitative way. But it is a
byway of thought. In most judgments all we believe is that x is
(or is not) y, that a thing is (or is not) determined, and that the
thing signified by the subject is a thing signified by the predicate,
but not that it is the only thing, or equal to everything signified
by the predicate. The symbolic logic, which confuses &ldquo;is&rdquo; with
&ldquo;is equal to,&rdquo; having introduced a particular kind of predicate
into the copula, falls into the mistake of reducing all predication
to the one category of the quantitative; whereas it is more often
in the substantial, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; not &ldquo;I am equal to a man,&rdquo;
or in the qualitative, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I am white,&rdquo; not &ldquo;I am equal to white,&rdquo;
or in the relative, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;I am born in sin,&rdquo; not &ldquo;I am equal to born
in sin.&rdquo; Predication, as Aristotle saw, is as various as the categories
of being. Finally, the great difficulty of the logic of judgment is
to find the mental act behind the linguistic expression, to ascribe
to it exactly what is thought, neither more nor less, and to apply
the judgment thought to the logical proposition, without expecting
to find it in ordinary propositions. Beneath Hamilton&rsquo;s postulate
there is a deeper principle of logic&mdash;<i>A rational being thinks only to
the point, and speaks only to understand and be understood</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Inference</span></p>

<p>The nature and analysis of inference have been so fully treated
in the Introduction that here we may content ourselves with
some points of detail.</p>

<p>1. <i>False Views of Syllogism arising from False Views of Judgment.</i>&mdash;The
false views of judgment, which we have been examining,
have led to false views of inference. On the one hand,
having reduced categorical judgments to an existential form,
Brentano proposes to reform the syllogism, with the results that
it must contain four terms, of which two are opposed and two
appear twice; that, when it is negative, both premises are negative;
and that, when it is affirmative, one premise, at least, is
negative. In order to infer the universal affirmative that every
professor is mortal because he is a man, Brentano&rsquo;s existential
syllogism would run as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i1">There is not a not-mortal man.</p>
<p class="i1">There is not a not-human professor.</p>
<p>&there4; There is not a non-mortal professor.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">On the other hand, if on the plan of Sigwart categorical universals
were reducible to hypothetical, the same inference would be a
pure hypothetical syllogism, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i1">If anything is a man it is mortal.</p>
<p class="i1">If anything is a professor it is a man.</p>
<p>&there4; If anything is a professor it is mortal.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">But both these unnatural forms, which are certainly not analyses
of any conscious process of categorical reasoning, break down at
once, because they cannot explain those moods in the third figure,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>Darapti</i>, which reason from universal premises to a particular
conclusion. Thus, in order to infer that some wise men are good
from the example of professors, Brentano&rsquo;s syllogism would be
the following <i>non-sequitur</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>There is not a not-good professor.</p>
<p>There is not a not-wise professor.</p>
<p>There is a wise good (<i>non-sequitur</i>).</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">So Sigwart&rsquo;s syllogism would be the following <i>non-sequitur</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>If anything is a professor, it is good.</p>
<p>If anything is a professor, it is wise.</p>
<p>Something wise is good (<i>non-sequitur</i>).</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">But as by the admission of both logicians these reconstructions of
<i>Darapti</i> are illogical, it follows that their respective reductions of
categorical universals to existentials and hypotheticals are false,
because they do not explain an actual inference. Sigwart does
not indeed shrink from this and greater absurdities; he reduces
the first figure to the <i>modus ponens</i> and the second to the <i>modus
tollens</i> of the hypothetical syllogism, and then, finding no place for
the third figure, denies that it can infer necessity; whereas it
really infers the necessary consequence of particular conclusions.
But the crowning absurdity is that, if all universals were hypothetical,
<i>Barbara</i> in the first figure would become a purely
hypothetical syllogism&mdash;a consequence which seems innocent
enough until we remember that all universal affirmative conclusions
in all sciences would with their premises dissolve into mere
hypothesis. No logic can be sound which leads to the following
analysis:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i1">If anything is a body it is extended.</p>
<p class="i1">If anything is a planet it is a body.</p>
<p>&there4; If anything is a planet it is extended.</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Sigwart, indeed, has missed the essential difference between the
categorical and the hypothetical construction of syllogisms. In a
categorical syllogism of the first figure, the major premise,
&ldquo;Every M whatever is P,&rdquo; is a universal, which we believe on
account of previous evidence without any condition about the
thing signified by the subject M, which we simply believe sometimes
to be existent (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Every man existent&rdquo;), and sometimes
not (<i>e.g.</i>, &ldquo;Every centaur conceivable&rdquo;); and the minor
premise, &ldquo;S is M,&rdquo; establishes no part of the major, but adds the
evidence of a particular not thought of in the major at all. But
in a hypothetical syllogism of the ordinary mixed type, the first
or hypothetical premise is a conditional belief, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;If anything
is M it is P,&rdquo; containing a hypothetical antecedent, &ldquo;If
anything is M,&rdquo; which is sometimes a hypothesis of existence
(<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;If anything is an angel&rdquo;), and sometimes a hypothesis
of fact (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;If an existing man is wise&rdquo;); and
the second premise or assumption, &ldquo;Something is M,&rdquo; establishes
part of the first, namely, the hypothetical antecedent,
whether as regards existence (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Something is an angel&rdquo;),
or as regards fact (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;This existing man is wise&rdquo;).
These very different relations of premises are obliterated by
Sigwart&rsquo;s false reduction of categorical universals to hypotheticals.
But even Sigwart&rsquo;s errors are outdone by Lotze, who
not only reduces &ldquo;Every M is P&rdquo; so &ldquo;If S is M, S is P,&rdquo; but
proceeds to reduce this hypothetical to the disjunctive, &ldquo;If S is
M, S is P<span class="sp">1</span> or P<span class="sp">2</span> or P<span class="sp">3</span>,&rdquo; and finds fault with the Aristotelian syllogism
because it contents itself with inferring &ldquo;S is P&rdquo; without
showing what P. Now there are occasions when we want to
reason in this disjunctive manner, to consider whether S is P<span class="sp">1</span> or
P<span class="sp">2</span> or P<span class="sp">3</span>, and to conclude that &ldquo;S is a particular P&rdquo;; but ordinarily
all we want to know is that &ldquo;S is P&rdquo;; <i>e.g.</i> in arithmetic,
that 2 + 2 are 4, not any particular 4, and in life that all our contemporaries
must die, without enumerating all their particular
sorts of deaths. Lotze&rsquo;s mistake is the same as that of Hamilton
about the quantification of the predicate, and that of those
symbolists who held that reasoning ought always to exhaust
all alternatives by equations. It is the mistake of exaggerating
exceptional into normal forms of thought, and ignoring the
principle that a rational being thinks only to the point.</p>

<p>2. <i>Quasi-syllogisms.</i>&mdash;Besides reconstructions of the syllogistic
fabric, we find in recent logic attempts to extend the figures of
the syllogism beyond the syllogistic rules. An old error that we
may have a valid syllogism from merely negative premises (<i>ex
omnibus negativis</i>), long ago answered by Alexander and Boethius,
is now revived by Lotze, Jevons and Bradley, who do not perceive
that the supposed second negative is really an affirmative
containing a &ldquo;not&rdquo; which can only be carried through the
syllogism by separating it from the copula and attaching it to
one of the extremes, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i1">The just are not unhappy (<i>negative</i>).</p>
<p class="i1">The just are not-recognized (<i>affirmative</i>).</p>
<p>&there4; Some not-recognized are not unhappy (<i>negative</i>).</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Here the minor being the infinite term &ldquo;not-recognized&rdquo; in the
conclusion, must be the same term also in the minor premise.
Schuppe, however, who is a fertile creator of quasi-syllogisms,
has managed to invent some examples from two negative
premises of a different kind:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">

<p class="noind">But (1) concludes with a mere repetition, (2) and (3) with a
contingent &ldquo;may be,&rdquo; which, as Aristotle says, also &ldquo;may not
be,&rdquo; and therefore <i>nihil certo colligitur</i>. The same answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page891" id="page891"></a>891</span>
applies to Schuppe&rsquo;s supposed syllogisms from two particular
premises:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc rb">(1)</td> <td class="tcc">(2)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;Some M is P.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;Some M is P.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;Some S is M.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;Some M is S.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; Some S may be P.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; Some S may be P.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">The only difference between these and the previous examples
(2) and (3) is that, while those break the rule against two negative
premises, these break that against undistributed middle. Equally
fallacious are two other attempts of Schuppe to produce syllogisms
from invalid moods:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc rb">(1) 1st Fig.</td> <td class="tcc">(2) 2nd Fig.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;All M is P.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;P is M.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;No S is M.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;S is M.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; S may be P.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; S is partially identical with P.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">In the first the fallacy is the indifferent contingency of the conclusion
caused by the <i>non-sequitur</i> from a negative premise to
an affirmative conclusion; while the second is either a mere
repetition of the premises if the conclusion means &ldquo;S is like
P in being M,&rdquo; or, if it means &ldquo;S is P,&rdquo; a <i>non-sequitur</i> on
account of the undistributed middle. It must not be thought
that this trifling with logical rules has no effect. The last
supposed syllogism, namely, that having two affirmative
premises and entailing an undistributed middle in the second
figure, is accepted by Wundt under the title &ldquo;Inference by
Comparison&rdquo; (<i>Vergleichungsschluss</i>), and is supposed by him to
be useful for abstraction and subsidiary to induction, and by
Bosanquet to be useful for analogy. Wundt, for example,
proposes the following premises:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Gold is a shining, fusible, ductile, simple body.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Metals are shining, fusible, ductile, simple bodies.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">But to say from these premises, &ldquo;Gold and metal are similar in
what is signified by the middle term,&rdquo; is a mere repetition of the
premises; to say, further, that &ldquo;Gold may be a metal&rdquo; is a
<i>non-sequitur</i>, because, the middle being undistributed, the logical
conclusion is the contingent &ldquo;Gold may or may not be a metal,&rdquo;
which leaves the question quite open, and therefore there is no
syllogism. Wundt, who is again followed by Bosanquet, also
supposes another syllogism in the third figure, under the title of
&ldquo;Inference by Connexion&rdquo; (<i>Verbindungsschluss</i>), to be useful
for induction. He proposes, for example, the following premises:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">Gold, silver, copper, lead, are fusible.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">Gold, silver, copper, lead, are metals.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Here there is no syllogistic fallacy in the premises; but the
question is what syllogistic conclusion can be drawn, and there
is only one which follows without an illicit process of the minor,
namely, &ldquo;Some metals are fusible.&rdquo; The moment we stir a step
further with Wundt m the direction of a more general conclusion
(<i>ein allgemeinerer Satz</i>), we cannot infer from the premises the
conclusion desired by Wundt, &ldquo;Metals and fusible are connected&rdquo;;
nor can we infer &ldquo;All metals are fusible,&rdquo; nor
&ldquo;Metals are fusible,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Metals may be fusible,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;All
metals may be fusible,&rdquo; nor any assertory conclusion, determinate
or indeterminate, but the indifferent contingent, &ldquo;All metals
may or may not be fusible,&rdquo; which leaves the question undecided,
so that there is no syllogism. We do not mean that in
Wundt&rsquo;s supposed &ldquo;inferences of relation by comparison and
connexion&rdquo; the premises are of no further use; but those of the
first kind are of no syllogistic use in the second figure, and those
of the second kind of no syllogistic use beyond particular conclusions
in the third figure. What they really are in the inferences
proposed by Wundt is not premises for syllogism, but data for
induction parading as syllogism. We must pass the same
sentence on Lotze&rsquo;s attempt to extend the second figure of the
syllogism for inductive purposes, thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;S is M.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;Q is M.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;R is M.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&there4; Every &Sigma;, which is common to S, Q, R, is M.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">We could not have a more flagrant abuse of the rule <i>Ne esto plus
minusque in conclusione quam in praemissis</i>. As we see from
Lotze&rsquo;s own defence, the conclusion cannot be drawn without
another premise or premises to the effect that &ldquo;S, Q, R, are &Sigma;,
and &Sigma; is the one real subject of M.&rdquo; But how is all this to be got
into the second figure? Again, Wundt and B. Erdmann propose
new moods of syllogism with convertible premises, containing
definitions and equations. Wundt&rsquo;s <i>Logic</i> has the following
forms:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc rb">(1) 1st Fig.</td> <td class="tcc rb">(2) 2nd Fig.</td> <td class="tcc">(3) 3rd Fig.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;Only M is P.</td> <td class="tcl rb">&emsp;x = y.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;y = x.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;No S is M.</td> <td class="tcl rb">&emsp;z = y.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;y = z.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; No S is P.</td> <td class="tcl rb">&there4; x = z.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; x = z.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Now, there is no doubt that, especially in mathematical equations,
universal conclusions are obtainable from convertible premises
expressed in these ways. But the question is how the premises
must be thought, and they must be thought in the converse way
to produce a logical conclusion. Thus, we must think in (1)
&ldquo;All P is M&rdquo; to avoid illicit process of the major, in (2) &ldquo;All
y is z&rdquo; to avoid undistributed middle, in (3) &ldquo;All x is y&rdquo; to
avoid illicit process of the minor. Indeed, it is the very essence
of a convertible judgment to think it in both orders, and especially
to think it in the order necessary to an inference from it.
Accordingly, however expressed, the syllogisms quoted above
are, as thought, ordinary syllogisms, (1) being <i>Camestres</i> in the
second figure, (2) and (3) <i>Barbara</i> in the first figure. Aristotle,
indeed, was as well aware as German logicians of the force of
convertible premises; but he was also aware that they require
no special syllogisms, and made it a point that, in a syllogism
from a definition, the definition is the middle, and the <i>definitum</i>
the major in a convertible major premise of <i>Barbara</i> in the first
figure, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;The interposition of an opaque body is (essentially) deprivation of light.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;The moon suffers the interposition of the opaque earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&there4; The moon suffers deprivation of light.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It is the same with all the recent attempts to extend the
syllogism beyond its rules, which are not liable to exceptions,
because they follow from the nature of syllogistic inference from
universal to particular. To give the name of syllogism to
inferences which infringe the general rules against undistributed
middle, illicit process, two negative premises, <i>non-sequitur</i>
from negative to affirmative, and the introduction of what
is not in the premises into the conclusion, and which consequently
infringe the special rules against affirmative conclusions
in the second figure, and against universal conclusions in the
third figure, is to open the door to fallacy, and at best to confuse
the syllogism with other kinds of inference, without enabling
us to understand any one kind.</p>

<p>3. <i>Analytic and Synthetic Deduction.</i>&mdash;Alexander the Commentator
defined synthesis as a progress from principles to
consequences, analysis as a regress from consequences to
principles; and Latin logicians preserved the same distinction
between the <i>progressus a principiis ad principiata</i>, and the
<i>regressus a principiatis ad principia</i>. No distinction is more
vital in the logic of inference in general and of scientific inference
in particular; and yet none has been so little understood, because,
though analysis is the more usual order of discovery, synthesis
is that of instruction, and therefore, by becoming more familiar,
tends to replace and obscure the previous analysis. The distinction,
however, did not escape Aristotle, who saw that a progressive
syllogism can be reversed thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc rb">1. <i>Progression.</i></td> <td class="tcc" colspan="2">2. <i>Regression.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcc rb">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc rb">(1)</td> <td class="tcc">(2)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;All M is P.</td> <td class="tcl rb">&emsp;All P is M.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;All S is P.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; All S is P.</td> <td class="tcl rb">&there4; All S is M.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; All M is P.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Proceeding from one order to the other, by converting one
of the premises, and substituting the conclusion as premise
for the other premise, so as to deduce the latter as conclusion,
is what he calls circular inference; and he remarked that the
process is fallacious unless it contains propositions which are
convertible, as in mathematical equations. Further, he perceived
that the difference between the progressive and regressive orders
extends from mathematics to physics, and that there are two
kinds of syllogism: one progressing a priori from real ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page892" id="page892"></a>892</span>
to consequent fact (<span class="grk" title="ho tou dioti syllogismos">&#8001; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>), and the other
regressing a posteriori from consequent fact to real ground
(<span class="grk" title="ho tou hoti syllogismos">&#8001; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8004;&#964;&#953; &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>). For example, as he says, the sphericity
of the moon is the real ground of the fact of its light waxing;
but we can deduce either from the other, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc rb">1. <i>Progression.</i></td> <td class="tcc">2. <i>Regression.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; The moon waxes.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; The moon is spherical.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">These two kinds of syllogism are synthesis and analysis in the
ancient sense. Deduction is analysis when it is regressive from
consequence to real ground, as when we start from the proposition
that the angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles and
deduce analytically that therefore (1) they are equal to equal
angles made by a straight line standing on another straight
line, and (2) such equal angles are two right angles. Deduction
is synthesis when it is progressive from real ground to consequence,
as when we start from these two results of analysis as principles
and deduce synthetically the proposition that therefore the
angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles, in the order
familiar to the student of Euclid. But the full value of the
ancient theory of these processes cannot be appreciated until
we recognize that as Aristotle planned them Newton used them.
Much of the <i>Principia</i> consists of synthetical deductions from
definitions and axioms. But the discovery of the centripetal
force of the planets to the sun is an analytic deduction from
the facts of their motion discovered by Kepler to their real
ground, and is so stated by Newton in the first regressive order
of Aristotle&mdash;P-M, S-P, S-M. Newton did indeed first show
synthetically what kind of motions by mechanical laws have
their ground in a centripetal force varying inversely as the
square of the distance (all P is M); but his next step was, not
to deduce synthetically the planetary motions, but to make a
new start from the planetary motions as facts established by
Kepler&rsquo;s laws and as examples of the kind of motions in question
(all S is P); and then, by combining these two premises, one
mechanical and the other astronomical, he analytically deduced
that these facts of planetary motion have their ground in a
centripetal force varying inversely as the squares of the distances
of the planets from the sun (all S is M). (See <i>Principia</i> I. prop.
2; 4 coroll. 6; III. Phaenomena, 4-5; prop. 2.) What Newton
did, in short, was to prove by analysis that the planets, revolving
by Kepler&rsquo;s astronomical laws round the sun, have motions
such as by mechanical laws are consequences of a centripetal
force to the sun. This done, as the major is convertible, the
analytic order&mdash;P-M, S-P, S-M&mdash;was easily inverted into the
synthetic order&mdash;M-P, S-M, S-P; and in this progressive order
the deduction as now taught begins with the centripetal force
of the sun as real ground, and deduces the facts of planetary
motion as consequences. Thereupon the Newtonian analysis
which preceded this synthesis, became forgotten; until at last
Mill in his <i>Logic</i>, neglecting the <i>Principia</i>, had the temerity
to distort Newton&rsquo;s discovery, which was really a pure example
of analytic deduction, into a mere hypothetical deduction; as
if the author of the saying &ldquo;<i>Hypotheses non fingo</i>&rdquo; started
from the hypothesis of a centripetal force to the sun, and thence
deductively explained the facts of planetary motion, which
reciprocally verified the hypothesis. This gross misrepresentation
has made hypothesis a kind of logical fashion. Worse still,
Jevons proceeded to confuse analytic deduction from consequence
to ground with hypothetical deduction from ground to <span class="correction" title="amended from conseguence">consequence</span>
under the common term &ldquo;inverse deduction.&rdquo; Wundt
attempts, but in vain, to make a compromise between the old
and the new. He re-defines analysis in the very opposite way
to the ancients; whereas they defined it as a regressive process
from consequence to ground, according to Wundt it is a progressive
process of taking for granted a proposition and deducing
a consequence, which being true verifies the proposition. He
then divides it into two species: one categorical, the other
hypothetical. By the categorical he means the ancient analysis
from a given proposition to more general propositions. By the
hypothetical he means the new-fangled analysis from a given
proposition to more particular propositions, <i>i.e.</i> from a hypothesis
to consequent facts. But his account of the first is imperfect,
because in ancient analysis the more general propositions,
with which it concludes, are not mere consequences, but the real
grounds of the given proposition; while his addition of the
second reduces the nature of analysis to the utmost confusion,
because hypothetical deduction is progressive from hypothesis
to consequent facts whereas analysis is regressive from
consequent facts to real ground. There is indeed a sense
in which all inference is from ground to consequence, because
it is from logical ground (<i>principium cognoscendi</i>) to logical
consequence. But in the sense in which deductive analysis
is opposed to deductive synthesis, analysis is deduction from
real consequence as logical ground (<i>principiatum</i> as <i>principium
cognoscendi</i>) to real ground (<i>principium essendi</i>), <i>e.g.</i> from the
consequential facts of planetary motion to their real ground,
<i>i.e.</i> centripetal force to the sun. Hence Sigwart is undoubtedly
right in distinguishing analysis from hypothetical deduction, for
which he proposes the name &ldquo;reduction.&rdquo; We have only
further to add that many scientific discoveries about sound, heat,
light, colour and so forth, which it is the fashion to represent
as hypotheses to explain facts, are really analytical deductions
from the facts to their real grounds in accordance with mechanical
laws. Recent logic does scant justice to scientific analysis.</p>

<p>4. <i>Induction.</i>&mdash;As induction is the process from particulars
to universals, it might have been thought that it would always
have been opposed to syllogism, in which one of the rules is
against using particular premises to draw universal conclusions.
Yet such is the passion for one type that from Aristotle&rsquo;s time
till now constant attempts have been made to reduce induction
to syllogism. Aristotle himself invented an inductive syllogism
in which the major (P) is to be referred to the middle (M) by
means of the minor (S), thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;A, B, C magnets (S) attract iron (P).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;A, B, C magnets (S) are all magnets whatever (M).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&there4; All magnets whatever (M) attract iron (P).</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">As the second premise is supposed to be convertible, he reduced
the inductive to a deductive syllogism as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;Every S is P.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;Every S is P.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;Every S is M (convertibly).</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;Every M is S.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; Every M is P.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; Every M is P.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">In the reduced form the inductive syllogism was described by
Aldrich as &ldquo;<i>Syllogismus in Barbara cujus minor</i> (<i>i.e.</i> every
M is S) <i>reticetur</i>.&rdquo; Whately, on the other hand, proposed an
inductive syllogism with the major suppressed, that is, instead
of the minor premise above, he supposed a major premise,
&ldquo;Whatever belongs to A, B, C magnets belongs to all.&rdquo; Mill
thereupon supposed a still more general premise, an assumption
of the uniformity of nature. Since Mill&rsquo;s time, however, the
logic of induction tends to revert towards syllogisms more like
that of Aristotle. Jevons supposed induction to be inverse
deduction, distinguished from direct deduction as analysis from
synthesis, <i>e.g.</i> as division from multiplication; but he really
meant that it is a deduction from a hypothesis of the law of a
cause to particular effects which, being true, verify the hypothesis.
Sigwart declares himself in agreement with Jevons; except that,
being aware of the difference between hypothetical deduction and
mathematical analysis, and seeing that, whereas analysis (<i>e.g.</i> in
division) leads to certain conclusions, hypothetical deduction
is not certain of the hypothesis, he arrives at the more definite
view that induction is not analysis proper but hypothetical
deduction, or &ldquo;reduction,&rdquo; as he proposes to call it. Reduction
he defines as &ldquo;the framing of possible premises for given propositions,
or the construction of a syllogism when the conclusion
and one premise is given.&rdquo; On this view induction becomes a
reduction in the form: all M is P (hypothesis), S is M (given),
&there4; S is P (given). The views of Jevons and Sigwart are in
agreement in two main points. According to both, induction,
instead of inferring from A, B, C magnets the conclusion &ldquo;Therefore
all magnets attract iron,&rdquo; infers from the hypothesis,
&ldquo;Let every magnet attract iron,&rdquo; to A, B, C magnets, whose
given attraction verifies the hypothesis. According to both,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page893" id="page893"></a>893</span>
again, the hypothesis of a law with which the process starts
contains more than is present in the particular data: according
to Jevons, it is the hypothesis of a law of a cause from which
induction deduces particular effects; and according to Sigwart,
it is a hypothesis of the ground from which the particular data
necessarily follow according to universal laws. Lastly, Wundt&rsquo;s
view is an interesting piece of eclecticism, for he supposes that
induction begins in the form of Aristotle&rsquo;s inductive syllogism,
S-P, S-M, M-P, and becomes an inductive method in the form
of Jevons&rsquo;s inverse deduction, or hypothetical deduction, or
analysis, M-P, S-M, S-P. In detail, he supposes that, while
an &ldquo;inference by comparison,&rdquo; which he erroneously calls an
affirmative syllogism in the second figure, is preliminary to
induction, a second &ldquo;inference by connexion,&rdquo; which he
erroneously calls a syllogism in the third figure with an indeterminate
conclusion, is the inductive syllogism itself. This is like
Aristotle&rsquo;s inductive syllogism in the arrangement of terms;
but, while on the one hand Aristotle did not, like Wundt, confuse
it with the third figure, on the other hand Wundt does not, like
Aristotle, suppose it to be practicable to get inductive data so
wide as the convertible premise, &ldquo;All S is M, and all M is S,&rdquo;
which would at once establish the conclusion, &ldquo;All M is P.&rdquo;
Wundt&rsquo;s point is that the conclusion of the inductive syllogism
is neither so much as all, nor so little as some, but rather the
indeterminate &ldquo;M and P are connected.&rdquo; The question therefore
arises, how we are to discover &ldquo;All M is P,&rdquo; and this question
Wundt answers by adding an inductive method, which involves
inverting the inductive syllogism in the style of Aristotle into a
deductive syllogism from a hypothesis in the style of Jevons,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc rb">(1)</td> <td class="tcc">(2)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;S is P.</td> <td class="tcc">Every M is P.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&emsp;S is M.</td> <td class="tcl">&emsp;S is M.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl rb">&there4; M and P are connected.</td> <td class="tcl">&there4; S is P.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">He agrees with Jevons in calling this second syllogism analytical
deduction, and with Jevons and Sigwart in calling it hypothetical
deduction. It is, in fact, a common point of Jevons, Sigwart and
Wundt that the universal is not really a conclusion inferred from
given particulars, but a hypothetical major premise from which
given particulars are inferred, and that this major contains
presuppositions of causation not contained in the particulars.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that Wundt quotes Newton&rsquo;s discovery of
the centripetal force of the planets to the sun as an instance of
this supposed hypothetical, analytic, inductive method; as if
Newton&rsquo;s analysis were a hypothesis of the centripetal force to the
sun, a deduction of the given facts of planetary motion, and a
verification of the hypothesis by the given facts, and as if such a
process of hypothetical deduction could be identical with either
analysis or induction. The abuse of this instance of Newtonian
analysis betrays the whole origin of the current confusion of
induction with deduction. One confusion has led to another.
Mill confused Newton&rsquo;s analytical deduction with hypothetical
deduction; and thereupon Jevons confused induction with both.
The result is that both Sigwart and Wundt transform the inductive
process of adducing particular examples to induce a
universal law into a deductive process of presupposing a universal
law as a ground to deduce particular consequences. But we
can easily extricate ourselves from these confusions by comparing
induction with different kinds of deduction. The point about
induction is that it starts from experience, and that, though in
most classes we can experience only some particulars individually,
yet we infer all. Hence induction cannot be reduced to Aristotle&rsquo;s
inductive syllogism, because experience cannot give the convertible
premise, &ldquo;Every S is M, and every M is S&rdquo;; that &ldquo;All
A, B, C are magnets&rdquo; is, but that &ldquo;All magnets are A, B, C&rdquo;
is not, a fact of experience. For the same reason induction
cannot be reduced to analytical deduction of the second kind in
the form, S-P, M-S, &there4; M-P; because, though both end in
a universal conclusion, the limits of experience prevent induction
from such inference as:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;Every experienced magnet attracts iron.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;Every magnet whatever is every experienced magnet.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&there4; Every magnet whatever attracts iron.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Still less can induction be reduced to analytical deduction of the
first kind in the form&mdash;P-M, S-P, &there4; S-M, of which Newton
has left so conspicuous an example in his <i>Principia</i>. As the
example shows, that analytic process starts from the scientific
knowledge of a universal and convertible law (every M is P, and
every P is M), <i>e.g.</i> a mechanical law of all centripetal force, and
ends in a particular application, <i>e.g.</i> this centripetal force of
planets to the sun. But induction cannot start from a known
law. Hence it is that Jevons, followed by Sigwart and Wundt,
reduces it to deduction from a hypothesis in the form &ldquo;Let every
M be P, S is M, &there4; S is P.&rdquo; There is a superficial resemblance
between induction and this hypothetical deduction. Both in a
way use given particulars as evidence. But in induction the
given particulars are the evidence by which we discover the
universal, <i>e.g.</i> particular magnets <span class="correction" title="amended from attracing">attracting</span> iron are the origin
of an inference that all do; in hypothetical deduction, the
universal is the evidence by which we explain the given particulars,
as when we suppose undulating aether to explain the
facts of heat and light. In the former process, the given particulars
are the data from which we infer the universal; in the
latter, they are only the consequent facts by which we verify it.
Or rather, there are two uses of induction: inductive discovery
before deduction, and inductive verification after deduction.
But neither use of induction is the same as the deduction itself:
the former precedes, the latter follows it. Lastly, the theory of
Mill, though frequently adopted, <i>e.g.</i> by B. Erdmann, need not
detain us long. Most inductions are made without any assumption
of the uniformity of nature; for, whether it is itself induced,
or a priori or postulated, this like every assumption is a judgment,
and most men are incapable of judgment on so universal
a scale, when they are quite capable of induction. The fact is
that the uniformity of nature stands to induction as the axioms
of syllogism do to syllogism; they are not premises, but conditions
of inference, which ordinary men use spontaneously,
as was pointed out in <i>Physical Realism</i>, and afterwards in Venn&rsquo;s
<i>Empirical Logic</i>. The axiom of contradiction is not a major
premise of a judgment: the <i>dictum de omni et nullo</i> is not a
major premise of a syllogism: the principle of uniformity is not
a major premise of an induction. Induction, in fact, is no species
of deduction; they are opposite processes, as Aristotle regarded
them except in the one passage where he was reducing the former
to the latter, and as Bacon always regarded them. But it is
easy to confuse them by mistaking examples of deduction for
inductions. Thus Whewell mistook Kepler&rsquo;s inference that
Mars moves in an ellipse for an induction, though it required the
combination of Tycho&rsquo;s and Kepler&rsquo;s observations, as a minor,
with the laws of conic sections discovered by the Greeks, as a
major, premise. Jevons, in his <i>Principles of Science</i>, constantly
makes the same sort of mistake. For example, the inference
from the similarity between solar spectra and the spectra of
various gases on the earth to the existence of similar gases in the
sun, is called by him an induction; but it really is an analytical

<p class="noind">In the same way, to infer a machine from hearing the regular
tick of a clock, to infer a player from finding a pack of cards
arranged in suits, to infer a human origin of stone implements,
and all such inferences from patent effects to latent causes,
though they appear to Jevons to be typical inductions, are really
deductions which, besides the minor premise stating the particular
effects, require a major premise discovered by a previous
induction and stating the general kind of effects of a general
kind of cause. B. Erdmann, again, has invented an induction
from particular predicates to a totality of predicates which he
calls &ldquo;ergänzende Induction,&rdquo; giving as an example, &ldquo;This
body has the colour, extensibility and specific gravity of magnesium;
therefore it is magnesium.&rdquo; But this inference contains
the tacit major, &ldquo;What has a given colour, &amp;c., is magnesium,&rdquo;
and is a syllogism of recognition. A deduction is often like an
induction, in inferring from particulars; the difference is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page894" id="page894"></a>894</span>
deduction combines a law in the major with the particulars in
the minor premise, and infers syllogistically that the particulars
of the minor have the predicate of the major premise, whereas
induction uses the particulars simply as instances to generalize
a law. An infallible sign of an induction is that the subject and
predicate of the universal conclusion are merely those of the
particular instances generalized; <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;These magnets attract
iron, &there4; all do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This brings us to another source of error. As we have seen,
Jevons, Sigwart and Wundt all think that induction contains a
belief in causation, in a cause, or ground, which is not present in
the particular facts of experience, but is contributed by a hypothesis
added as a major premise to the particulars in order to
explain them by the cause or ground. Not so; when an induction
is causal, the particular instances are already beliefs in
particular causes, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;My right hand is exerting pressure
reciprocally with my left,&rdquo; &ldquo;A, B, C magnets attract iron&rdquo;;
and the problem is to generalize these causes, not to introduce
them. Induction is not introduction. It would make no difference
to the form of induction, if, as Kant thought, the notion of
causality is a priori; for even Kant thought that it is already
contained in experience. But whether Kant be right or wrong,
Wundt and his school are decidedly wrong in supposing &ldquo;supplementary
notions which are not contained in experience itself,
but are gained by a process of logical treatment of this experience&rdquo;;
as if our behalf in causality could be neither a posteriori
nor a priori, but beyond experience wake up in a hypothetical
major premise of induction. Really, we first experience that
particular causes have particular effects; then induce that
causes similar to those have effects similar to these; finally,
deduce that when a particular cause of the kind occurs it has a
particular effect of the kind by synthetic deduction, and that
when a particular effect of the kind occurs it has a particular
cause of the kind by analytic deduction with a convertible
premise, as when Newton from planetary motions, like terrestrial
motions, analytically deduced a centripetal force to the sun like
centripetal forces to the earth. Moreover, causal induction is
itself both synthetic and analytic: according as experiment
combines elements into a compound, or resolves a compound into
elements, it is the origin of a synthetic or an analytic generalization.
Not, however, that all induction is causal; but where it
is not, there is still less reason for making it a deduction from
hypothesis. When from the fact that the many crows in our
experience are black, we induce the probability that all crows
whatever are black, the belief in the particulars is quite independent
of this universal. How then can this universal be called,
as Sigwart, for example, calls it, the ground from which these
particulars follow? I do not believe that the crows I have seen
are black because all crows are black, but vice versa. Sigwart
simply inverts the order of our knowledge. In all induction, as
Aristotle said, the particulars are the evidence, or ground of our
knowledge (<i>principium cognoscendi</i>), of the universal. In causal
induction, the particulars further contain the cause, or ground
of the being (<i>principium essendi</i>), of the effect, as well as the
ground of our inducing the law. In all induction the universal
is the conclusion, in none a major premise, and in none the
ground of either the being or the knowing of the particulars.
Induction is generalization. It is not syllogism in the form of
Aristotle&rsquo;s or Wundt&rsquo;s inductive syllogism, because, though
starting only from some particulars, it concludes with a universal;
it is not syllogism in the form called inverse deduction by Jevons,
reduction by Sigwart, inductive method by Wundt, because it
often uses particular facts of causation to infer universal laws
of causation; it is not syllogism in the form of Mill&rsquo;s syllogism
from a belief in uniformity of nature, because few men have
believed in uniformity, but all have induced from particulars
to universals. Bacon alone was right in altogether opposing
induction to syllogism, and in finding inductive rules for the
inductive process from particular instances of presence, absence
in similar circumstances, and comparison.</p>

<p>5. <i>Inference in General.</i>&mdash;There are, as we have seen (<i>ad init.</i>),
three types&mdash;syllogism, induction and analogy. Different as
they are, the three kinds have something in common: first,
they are all processes from similar to similar; secondly, they all
consist in combining two judgments so as to cause a third,
whether expressed in so many propositions or not; thirdly, as a
judgment is a belief in being, they all proceed from premises
which are beliefs in being to a conclusion which is a belief in being.
Nevertheless, simple as this account appears, it is opposed in
every point to recent logic. In the first place, the point of
Bradley&rsquo;s logic is that &ldquo;similarity is not a principle which works.
What operates is identity, and that identity is a universal.&rdquo;
This view makes inference easy: induction is all over before it
begins; for, according to Bradley, &ldquo;every one of the instances
is already a universal proposition; and it is not a particular
fact or phenomenon at all,&rdquo; so that the moment you observe
that this magnet attracts iron, you <i>ipso facto</i> know that every
magnet does so, and all that remains for deduction is to identify
a second magnet as the same with the first, and conclude that it
attracts iron. In dealing with Bradley&rsquo;s works we feel inclined
to repeat what Aristotle says of the discourses of Socrates: they
all exhibit excellence, cleverness, novelty and inquiry, but their
truth is a difficult matter; and the Socratic paradox that virtue
is knowledge is not more difficult than the Bradleian paradox that
as two different things are the same, inference is identification.
The basis of Bradley&rsquo;s logic is the fallacious dialectic of Hegel&rsquo;s
metaphysics, founded on the supposition that two things, which
are different, but have something in common, are the same.
For example, according to Hegel, being and not-being are both
indeterminate and therefore the same. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says Bradley,
&ldquo;A and B, for instance, both have lungs or gills, they are so far
the same.&rdquo; The answer to Hegel is that being and not-being
are at most similarly indeterminate, and to Bradley that each
animal has its own different lungs, whereby they are only similar.
If they were the same, then in descending, two things, one of
which has healthy and the other diseased lungs, would be the
same; and in ascending, two things, one of which has lungs and
the other has not, but both of which have life, <i>e.g.</i> plants and
animals, would be so far the same. There would be no limit to
identity either downwards or upwards; so that a man would be
the same as a man-of-war, and all things would be the same
thing, and not different parts of one universe. But a thing
which has healthy lungs and a thing which has diseased lungs are
only similar individuals numerically different. Each individual
thing is the same only with itself, although related to other things;
and each individual of a class has its own individual, though
similar, attributes. The consequence of this true metaphysics
to logic is twofold: on the one hand, one singular or particular
judgment, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;this magnet attracts iron,&rdquo; is not another, <i>e.g.</i>
&ldquo;that magnet attracts iron,&rdquo; and neither is universal; on the
other hand, a universal judgment, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;every magnet attracts
iron,&rdquo; means, distributively, that each individual magnet exerts
its individual attraction, though it is similar to other magnets
exerting similar attractions. A universal is not &ldquo;one identical
point,&rdquo; but one distributive whole. Hence in a syllogism, a
middle term, <i>e.g.</i> magnets, is &ldquo;absolutely the same,&rdquo; not in the
sense of &ldquo;one identical point&rdquo; making each individual the same
as any other, as Bradley supposes, but only in the sense of one
whole class, or total of many similar individuals, <i>e.g.</i> magnets,
each of which is separately though similarly a magnet, not magnet
in general. Hence also induction is a real process, because,
when we know that this individual magnet attracts iron, we are
very far from knowing that all alike do so similarly; and the
question of inductive logic, how we get from some similars to all
similars, remains, as before, a difficulty, but not to be solved by
the fallacy that inference is identification.</p>

<p>Secondly, a subordinate point in Bradley&rsquo;s logic is that there
are inferences which are not syllogisms; and this is true. But
when he goes on to propose, as a complete independent inference,
&ldquo;A is to the right of B, B is to the right of C, therefore A is to
the right of C,&rdquo; he confuses two different operations. When A,
B and C are objects of sense, their relative positions are matters,
not of inference, but of observation; when they are not, there is
an inference, but a syllogistic inference with a major premise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page895" id="page895"></a>895</span>
induced from previous observations, &ldquo;whenever of three things
the first is to the right of the second, and the second to the right
of the third, the first is to the right of the third.&rdquo; To reply
that this universal judgment is not expressed, or that its expression
is cumbrous, is no answer, because, whether expressed or
not, it is required for the thought. As Aristotle puts it, the
syllogism is directed &ldquo;not to the outer, but to the inner discourse,&rdquo;
or as we should say, not to the expression but to the
thought, not to the proposition but to the judgment, and to the
inference not verbally but mentally. Bradley seems to suppose
that the major premise of a syllogism must be explicit, or else
is nothing at all. But it is often thought without being expressed,
and to judge the syllogism by its mere explicit expression is to
commit an <i>ignoratio elenchi</i>; for it has been known all along that
we express less than we think, and the very purpose of syllogistic
logic is to analyse the whole thought necessary to the conclusion.
In this syllogistic analysis two points must always be considered:
one, that we usually use premises in thought which we do
not express; and the other, that we sometimes use them
unconsciously, and therefore infer and reason unconsciously,
in the manner excellently described by Zeller in his <i>Vorträge</i>,
iii. pp. 249-255. Inference is a deeper thinking process from
judgments to judgment, which only occasionally and partially
emerges in the linguistic process from propositions to proposition.
We may now then reassert two points about inference against
Bradley&rsquo;s logic: the first, that it is a process from similar to
similar, and not a process of identification, because two different
things are not at all the same thing; the second, that it is the
mental process from judgments to judgment rather than the
linguistic process from propositions to proposition, because,
besides the judgments expressed in propositions, it requires
judgments which are not always expressed, and are sometimes
even unconscious.</p>

<p>Our third point is that, as a process of judgments, inference
is a process of concluding from two beliefs in being to another
belief in being, and not an ideal construction, because a judgment
does not always require ideas, but is always a belief about things,
existing or not. This point is challenged by all the many ideal
theories of judgment already quoted. If, for example, judgment
were an analysis of an aggregate idea as Wundt supposes, it
would certainly be true with him to conclude that &ldquo;as judgment
is an <i>immediate</i>, inference is a <i>mediate</i>, reference of the members
of an aggregate of ideas to one another.&rdquo; But really a judgment
is a belief that something, existing, or thinkable, or nameable
or what not, is (or is not) determined; and inference is a process
from and to such beliefs in being. Hence the fallacy of those
who, like Bosanquet, or like Paulsen in his <i>Einleitung in die
Philosophie</i>, represent the realistic theory of inference as if it
meant that knowledge starts from ideas and then infers that ideas
are copies of things, and who then object, rightly enough, that
we could not in that case compare the copy with the original,
but only be able to infer from idea to idea. But there is another
realism which holds that inference is a process neither from
ideas to ideas, nor from ideas to things, but from beliefs to
beliefs, from judgments about things in the premises to judgments
about similar things in the conclusion. Logical inference never
goes through the impossible process of premising nothing but
ideas, and concluding that ideas are copies of things. Moreover,
as we have shown, our primary judgments of sense are beliefs
founded on sensations without requiring ideas, and are beliefs,
not merely that something is determined, but that it is determined
as existing; and, accordingly, our primary inferences
from these sensory judgments of existence are inferences that
other things beyond sense are similarly determined as existing.
First press your lips together and then press a pen between
them: you will not be conscious of perceiving any ideas: you
will be conscious first of perceiving one existing lip exerting
pressure reciprocally with the other existing lip; then, on putting
the pen between your lips, of perceiving each lip similarly exerting
pressure, but not with the other; and consequently of inferring
that each existing lip is exerting pressure reciprocally with another
existing body, the pen. Inference then, though it is accompanied
by ideas, is not an ideal construction, nor a process from idea to
idea, nor a process from idea to thing, but a process from direct
to indirect beliefs in things, and originally in existing things.
Logic cannot, it is true, decide what these things are, nor what
the senses know about them, without appealing to metaphysics
and psychology. But, as the science of inference, it can make
sure that inference, on the one hand, starts from sensory judgments
about sensible things and logically proceeds to inferential
judgments about similar things beyond sense, and, on the other
hand, cannot logically go beyond the similar. These are the
limits within which logical inference works, because its nature
essentially consists in proceeding from two judgments to another
about similar things, existing or not.</p>

<p>6. <i>Truth.</i>&mdash;Finally, though sensory judgment is always true
of its sensible object, inferential judgments are not always true,
but are true so far as they are logically inferred, however indirectly,
from sense; and knowledge consists of sense, memory
after sense and logical inference from sense, which, we must
remember, is not merely the outer sense of our five senses, but
also the inner sense of ourselves as conscious thinking persons.
We come then at last to the old question&mdash;what is truth?
Truth proper, as Aristotle said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, is in the mind:
it is not being, but one&rsquo;s signification of being. Its requisites are
that there are things to be known and powers of knowing things.
It is an attribute of judgments and derivatively of propositions.
That judgment is true which apprehends a thing as it is capable
of being known to be; and that proposition is true which so
asserts the thing to be. Or, to combine truth in thought and in
speech, the true is what signifies a thing as it is capable of being
known. Secondarily, the thing itself is ambiguously said to be
true in the sense of being signified as it is. For example, as I
am weary and am conscious of being weary, my judgment and
proposition that I am weary are true because they signify what
I am and know myself to be by direct consciousness; and my
being weary is ambiguously said to be true because it is so
signified. But it will be said that Kant has proved that real
truth, in the sense of the &ldquo;agreement of knowledge with the
object,&rdquo; is unattainable, because we could compare knowledge
with the object only by knowing both. Sigwart, indeed, adopting
Kant&rsquo;s argument, concludes that we must be satisfied with consistency
among the thoughts which presuppose an existent;
this, too, is the reason why he thinks that induction is reduction,
on the theory that we can show the necessary consequence of the
given particular, but that truth of fact is unattainable. But
Kant&rsquo;s criticism and Sigwart&rsquo;s corollary only derive plausibility
from a false definition of truth. Truth is not the agreement of
knowledge with an object beyond itself, and therefore <i>ex hypothesi</i>
unknowable, but the agreement of our judgments with the objects
of our knowledge. A judgment is true whenever it is a belief
that a thing is determined as it is known to be by sense, or by
memory after sense, or by inference from sense, however indirect
the inference may be, and even when in the form of inference
of non-existence it extends consequently from primary to
secondary judgments. Thus the judgments &ldquo;this sensible
pressure exists,&rdquo; &ldquo;that sensible pressure existed,&rdquo; &ldquo;other
similar pressures exist,&rdquo; &ldquo;a conceivable centaur does not exist
but is a figment,&rdquo; are all equally true, because they are in
accordance with one or other of these kinds of knowledge.
Consequently, as knowledge is attainable by sense, memory and
inference, truth is also attainable, because, though we cannot test
what we know by something else, we can test what we judge and
assert by what we know. Not that all inference is knowledge,
but it is sometimes. The aim of logic in general is to find the laws
of all inference, which, so far as it obeys those laws, is always
consistent, but is true or false according to its data as well as its
consistency; and the aim of the special logic of knowledge is to
find the laws of direct and indirect inferences from sense, because
as sense produces sensory judgments which are always true of the
sensible things actually perceived, inference from sense produces
inferential judgments which, so far as they are consequent on
sensory judgments, are always true of things similar to sensible
things, by the very consistency of inference, or, as we say, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page896" id="page896"></a>896</span>
parity of reasoning. We return then to the old view of Aristotle,
that truth is believing in being; that sense is true of its immediate
objects, and reasoning from sense true of its mediate objects;
and that logic is the science of reasoning with a view to truth, or
<i>Logica est ars ratiocinandi, ut discernatur verum a falso</i>. All we
aspire to add is that, in order to attain to real truth, we must
proceed gradually from sense, memory and experience through
analogical particular inference, to inductive and deductive
universal inference or reasoning. Logic is the science of all
inference, beginning from sense and ending in reason.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the logic of the last quarter of the 19th century
may be said to be animated by a spirit of inquiry, marred by
a love of paradox and a corresponding hatred of tradition. But
we have found, on the whole, that logical tradition rises superior
to logical innovation. There are two old logics which still remain
indispensable, Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Organon</i> and Bacon&rsquo;s <i>Novum Organum</i>.
If, and only if, the study of deductive logic begins with Aristotle,
and the study of inductive logic with Aristotle and Bacon, it will
be profitable to add the works of the following recent German
and English authors:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">II. History</span></p>

<p>Logic cannot dispense with the light afforded by its history so
long as counter-solutions of the same fundamental problems
continue to hold the field. A critical review of some of the chief
types of logical theory, with a view to determine development,
needs no further justification.</p>

<p>Logic arose, at least for the Western world, in the golden age
of Greek speculation which culminated in Plato and Aristotle.
There is an Indian logic, it is true, but its priority is more than
disputable. In any case no influence upon Greek thought
can be shown. The movement which ends in the logic of Aristotle
is demonstrably self-contained. When we have shaken
ourselves free of the prejudice that all stars are first seen in the
East, Oriental attempts at analysis of the structure of thought
may be treated as negligible.</p>

<p>It is with Aristotle that the bookish tradition begins to dominate
the evolution of logic. The technical perfection of the analysis
which he offers is, granted the circle of presuppositions within
which it works, so decisive, that what precedes, even Plato&rsquo;s
logic, is not unnaturally regarded as merely preliminary and
subsidiary to it. What follows is inevitably, whether directly or
indirectly, by sympathy or by antagonism, affected by the
Aristotelian tradition.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">A. Greek Logic</span></p>

<p class="center">i. <i>Before Aristotle</i></p>

<p>Logic needs as its presuppositions that thought should distinguish
itself from things and from sense, that the problem of
validity should be seen to be raised in the field of
thought itself, and that analysis of the structure of
<span class="sidenote">The physical philosophers.</span>
thought should be recognized as the one way of solution.
Thought is somewhat late in coming to self-consciousness.
Implied in every contrast of principle and fact, of rule and
application, involved as we see after the event, most decisively
when we react correctly upon a world incorrectly perceived,
thought is yet not reflected on in the common experience. Its
so-called natural logic is only the potentiality of logic. The
same thing is true of the first stage of Greek philosophy. In
seeking for a single material principle underlying the multiplicity
of phenomena, the first nature-philosophers, Thales and the rest,
did indeed raise the problem of the one and the many, the
endeavour to answer which must at last lead to logic. But it is
only from a point of view won by later speculation that it can
be said that they sought to determine the predicates of the single
subject-reality, or to establish the permanent subject of varied
and varying predicates.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The direction of their inquiry is persistently
outward. They hope to explain the opposed appearance
and reality wholly within the world of things, and irrespective
of the thought that thinks things. Their universal is still a
material one. The level of thought on which they move is still
clearly pre-logical. It is an advance on this when Heraclitus<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
opposes to the eyes and ears which are bad witnesses &ldquo;for such
as understand not their language&rdquo; a common something which
we would do well to follow; or again when in the incommensurability
of the diagonal and side of a square the Pythagoreans
stumbled upon what was clearly neither thing nor image
of sense, but yet was endowed with meaning, and henceforth
were increasingly at home with symbol and formula. So far,
however, it might well be that thought, contradistinguished
from sense with its illusions, was itself infallible. A further step,
then, was necessary, and it was taken at any rate by the Eleatics,
when they opposed their thought to the thought of others, as
the way of truth in contrast to the way of opinion. If Eleatic
thought stands over against Pythagorean thought as what is
valid or grounded against what is ungrounded or invalid, we
are embarked upon dialectic, or the debate in which thought is
countered by thought. Claims to a favourable verdict must now
be substantiated in this field and in this field alone. It was Zeno,
the controversialist of the Eleatic school, who was regarded in
after times as the &ldquo;discoverer&rdquo; of dialectic.<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Zeno&rsquo;s amazing skill in argumentation and his paradoxical conclusions,
particular and general, inaugurate a new era. &ldquo;The
philosophical mind,&rdquo; says waiter Pater,<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> &ldquo;will perhaps never be
quite in health, quite sane or natural again.&rdquo; The give and take of
thought had by a swift transformation of values come by something
more than its own. Zeno&rsquo;s paradoxes, notably, for example, the
puzzle of Achilles and the Tortoise, are still capable of amusing the
modern world. In his own age they found him imitators. And
there follows the sophistic movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page897" id="page897"></a>897</span></p>

<p>The sophists have other claims to consideration than their service
to the development of logic. In the history of the origins of logic
the sophistic age is simply the age of the free play of
thought in which men were aware that in a sense anything
<span class="sidenote">The Sophists.</span>
can be debated and not yet aware of the sense in which
all things cannot be so. It is the age of discussion used as a universal
solvent, before it has been brought to book by a deliberate unfolding
of the principles of the structure of thought determining and limiting
the movement of thought itself. The sophists furthered the transition
from dialectic to logic in two ways. In the first place they
made it possible. Incessant questioning leads to answers. Hair-splitting,
even when mischievous in intent, leads to distinctions of
value. Paradoxical insistence on the accidents of speech-forms
and thought-forms leads in the end to perception of the essentials.
Secondly they made it necessary. The spirit of debate run riot
evokes a counter-spirit to order and control it. The result is a self-limiting
dialectic. This higher dialectic is a logic. It is no accident
that the first of the philosophical sophists, Gorgias, on the one
hand, is Eleatic in his affinities, and on the other raises in the characteristic
formula of his intellectual nihilism<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a> issues which are as
much logical and epistemological as ontological. The meaning of
the copula and the relation of thoughts to the objects of which
they are the thoughts are as much involved as the nature of being.
It is equally no accident that the name of Protagoras is to be connected,
in Plato&rsquo;s view at least, with the rival school of Heracliteans.
The problems raised by the relativism of Protagoras are no less
fundamentally problems of the nature of knowledge and of the
structure of thought. The <i>Theaetetus</i> indeed, in which Plato essays
to deal with them, is in the broad sense of the word logical, the
first distinctively logical treatise that has come down to us. Other
sophists, of course, with more practical interests, or of humbler
attainments, were content to move on a lower plane of philosophical
speculation. As presented to us, for example, in Plato&rsquo;s surely not
altogether hostile caricature in the <i>Euthydemus</i>, they mark the
intellectual preparation for, and the moral need for, the advance
of the next generation.</p>

<p>Among the pioneers of the sophistic age Socrates stands apart.
He has no other instrument than the dialectic of his compeers, and
he is as far off as the rest from a criticism of the instrument,
but he uses it differently and with a difference of aim.
<span class="sidenote">Socrates.</span>
He construes the give and take of the debate-game with extreme
rigour. The rhetorical element must be exorcised. The set harangue
of teacher to pupil, in which steps in argument are slurred and the
semblance of co-inquiry is rendered nugatory, must be eliminated.
The interlocutors must in truth render an account under the stimulus
of organized heckling from their equals or superiors in debating
ability. And the aim is heuristic, though often enough the search
ends in no overt positive conclusion. Something can be found and
something is found. Common names are fitted for use by the would-be
users being first delivered from abortive conceptions, and thereupon
enabled to bring to the birth living and organic notions.</p>

<p>Aristotle would assign to Socrates the elaboration of two logical
functions:&mdash;general definition and inductive method.<a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Rightly,
if we add that he gives no theory of either, and that his practical
use of the latter depends for its value on selection.<a name="fa7b" id="fa7b" href="#ft7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a> It is rather
in virtue of his general faith in the possibility of construction, which
he still does not undertake, and because of his consequent insistence
on the elucidation of general concepts, which in common with some
of his contemporaries, he may have thought of as endued with a
certain objectivity, that he induces the controversies of what are
called the Socratic schools as to the nature of predication. These
result in the formulation of a new dialectic or logic by Plato. Manifestly
Socrates&rsquo; use of certain forms of argumentation, like their
abuse by the sophists, tended to evoke their logical analysis. The
use and abuse, confronted one with the other, could not but evoke it.</p>

<p>The one in the many, the formula which lies at the base of the
possibility of predication, is involved in the Socratic doctrine of
general concepts or ideas. The nihilism of Gorgias from the Eleatic
point of view of bare identity, and the speechlessness of Cratylus
from the Heraclitean ground of absolute difference, are alike disowned.
But the one in the many, the identity in difference, is so
far only postulated, not established. When the personality of
Socrates is removed, the difficulty as to the nature of the Socratic
universal, developed in the medium of the individual processes of
individual minds, carries disciples of diverse general sympathies,
united only through the practical inspiration of the master&rsquo;s life,
towards the identity-formula or the difference-formula of other
teachers. The paradox of predication, that it seems to deny
identity, or to deny difference, becomes a <i>pons asinorum</i>. Knowledge
involves synthesis or nexus. Yet from the points of view
alike of an absolute pluralism, of a flux, and of a formula of bare
identity&mdash;and <i>a fortiori</i> with any blending of these principles
sufficiently within the bounds of plausibility to find an exponent&mdash;all
knowledge, because all predication of unity, in difference, must
be held to be impossible. Plato&rsquo;s problem was to find a way of
escape from this impasse, and among his Socratic contemporaries
he seems to have singled out Antisthenes<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a> as most in need of refutation.
Antisthenes, starting with the doctrine of
<span class="sidenote">Antisthenes.</span>
identity without difference, recognizes as the only expression
proper to anything its own peculiar sign, its
name. This extreme of nominalism for which predication is impossible
is, however, compromised by two concessions. A thing can
be described as like something else. And a compound can have a
<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> or account given of it by the (literally) adequate enumeration
of the names of its simple elements or <span class="grk" title="prôta">&#960;&#961;&#8182;&#964;&#945;</span>.<a name="fa9b" id="fa9b" href="#ft9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a> This analytical <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>
he offers as his substitute for knowledge.<a name="fa10b" id="fa10b" href="#ft10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a> The simple elements still
remain, sensed and named but not known. The expressions of them
are simply the speech-signs for them. The account of the compound
simply sets itself taken piecemeal as equivalent to itself taken as
aggregate. The subject-predicate relation fails really to arise.
Euclides<a name="fa11b" id="fa11b" href="#ft11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a> found no difficulty in fixing Antisthenes&rsquo; mode of illustrating
his simple elements by comparison, and therewith perhaps
the &ldquo;induction&rdquo; of Socrates, with the dilemma; so far as the
example is dissimilar, the comparison is invalid; so far as it is
similar, it is useless. It is better to say what the thing is. Between
Euclides and Antisthenes the Socratic induction and universal
definition were alike discredited from the point of view of the Eleatic
logic. It is with the other point of doctrine that Plato comes to
grips, that which allows of a certainty or knowledge consisting in
an analysis of a compound into simple elements themselves not
known. The syllable or combination is, he shows, not known by
resolution of it into letters or elements themselves not known. An
aggregate analysed into its mechanical parts is as much and as
little known as they. A whole which is more than its parts is from
Antisthenes&rsquo; point of view inconceivable. Propositions analytical
of a combination in the sense alleged do not give knowledge. Yet
knowledge is possible. The development of a positive theory of
predication has become quite crucial.</p>
</div>

<p>Plato&rsquo;s logic supplies a theory of universals in the doctrine
of ideas. Upon this it bases a theory of predication, which,
however, is compatible with more than one reading of
the metaphysical import of the ideas. And it sets
<span class="sidenote">Plato.</span>
forth a dialectic with a twofold movement, towards differentiation
and integration severally, which amounts to a formulation
of inference. The more fully analysed movement, that which
proceeds downward from less determinate to more determinate
universals, is named Division. Its associations, accordingly,
are to the modern ear almost inevitably those of a doctrine
of classification only. Aristotle, however, treats it as a dialectical
rival to syllogism, and it influenced Galilei and Bacon
in their views of inference after the Renaissance. If we add to
this logic of &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; judgment and inference, a doctrine of
categories in the modern sense of the word which makes the
<i>Theaetetus</i>, in which it first occurs, a forerunner of Kant&rsquo;s <i>Critique
of Pure Reason</i>, we have clearly a very significant contribution
to logic even in technical regard. Its general philosophical
setting may be said to enhance its value even as logic.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Of the idea we may say that whatever else it is, and apart
from all puzzles as to ideas of relations such as smallness, of
negative qualities such as injustice, or of human
inventions such as beds, it is opposed to that of which
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Idea.&rdquo;</span>
it is the idea as its intelligible formula or law, the truth
or validity&mdash;Herbart&rsquo;s word&mdash;of the phenomenon from the point
of view of nexus or system. The thing of sense in its relative
isolation is unstable. It is and is not. What gives stability is
the insensible principle or principles which it holds, as it were, in
solution. These are the ideas, and their mode of being is naturally
quite other than that of the sensible phenomena which they
order. The formula for an indefinite number of particular
things in particular places at particular times, and all of them
presentable in sensuous imagery of a given time and place, is not
itself presentable in sensuous imagery side by side with the
individual members of the group it orders. The law, <i>e.g.</i>, of the
equality of the radii of a circle cannot be exhibited to sense,
even if equal radii may be so exhibited. It is the wealth of
illustration with which Plato expresses his meaning, and the
range of application which he gives the idea&mdash;to the class-concepts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page898" id="page898"></a>898</span>
of natural groups objectively regarded, to categories,
to aesthetic and ethical ideals, to the concrete aims of the
craftsman as well as to scientific laws&mdash;that have obscured his
doctrine, viz. that wherever there is law, there is an idea.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The paradox of the one in the many is none, if the idea
may be regarded as supplying a principle of nexus or organization
to an indefinite multiplicity of particulars. But if
Antisthenes is to be answered, a further step must be
<span class="sidenote">The one in the many.</span>
taken. The principle of difference must be carried
into the field of the ideas. Not only sense is a principle
of difference. The ideas are many. The multiplicity in unity
must be established within thought itself. Otherwise the
objection stands: man is man and good is good, but to say that
man is good is clearly to say the thing that is not. Plato replies
with the doctrine of the interpenetration of ideas, obviously
not of all with all, but of some with some, the formula of identity
in difference within thought itself. Nor can the opponent fairly
refuse to admit it, if he affirms the participation of the identical
with being, and denies the participation of difference with being,
or affirms it with not-being. The <i>Sophistes</i> shows among other
things that an identity-philosophy breaks down into a dualism
of thought and expression, when it applies the predicate of unity
to the real, just as the absolute pluralism on the other hand
collapses into unity if it affirms or admits any form of relation
whatsoever. Identity and difference are all-pervasive categories,
and the speech-form and the corresponding thought-form involve
both. For proposition and judgment involve subject and
predicate and exhibit what a modern writer calls &ldquo;identity of
reference with diversity of characterization.&rdquo; Plato proceeds
to explain by his principle of difference both privative and
negative predicates, and also the possibility of false predication.
It is obvious that without the principle of difference error is
inexplicable. Even Plato, however, perhaps scarcely shows that
with it, and nothing else but it, error is explained.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Plato&rsquo;s Division, or the articulation of a relatively indeterminate
and generic concept into species and sub-species with
resultant determinate judgments, presumes of course
the doctrine of the interpenetration of ideas laid down
<span class="sidenote">Division.</span>
in the <i>Sophistes</i> as the basis of predication, but its use precedes
the positive development of that formula, though not, save very
vaguely, the exhibition of it, negatively, in the antinomies of
the one and the many in the <i>Parmenides</i>. It is its use, however,
not the theory of it, that precedes. The latter is expounded in
the <i>Politicus</i> (260 sqq.) and <i>Philebus</i> (16<i>c</i> sqq.). The ideal is
progressively to determine a universe of discourse till true
<i>infimae species</i> are reached, when no further distinction in the
determinate many is possible, though there is still the numerical
difference of the indefinite plurality of particulars. The process
is to take as far as possible the form of a continuous disjunction
of contraries. We must bisect as far as may be, but the division
is after all to be into limbs, not parts. The later examples of
the <i>Politicus</i> show that the permission of three or more co-ordinate
species is not nugatory, and that the precept of dichotomy
is merely in order to secure as little of a <i>saltus</i> as possible;
to avoid <i>e.g.</i> the division of the animal world into men and brutes.
It is the middle range of the <span class="grk" title="mesa">&#956;&#941;&#963;&#945;</span> of <i>Philebus</i> 17<i>a</i> that appeals
to Bacon, not only this but their mediating quality that appeals
to Aristotle. The <i>media axiomata</i> of the one and the <i>middle
term</i> of the other lie in the phrase. Plato&rsquo;s division is nevertheless
neither syllogism nor <i>exclusiva</i>. It is not syllogism
because it is based on the disjunctive, not on the hypothetical
relation, and so extends horizontally where syllogism strikes
vertically downward. Again it is not syllogism because it is
necessarily and finally dialectical. It brings in the choice of an
interlocutor at each stage, and so depends on a concession for
what it should prove.<a name="fa12b" id="fa12b" href="#ft12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Nor is it Bacon&rsquo;s method of exclusions,
which escapes the imputation of being dialectical, if not that of
being unduly cumbrous, in virtue of the cogency of the negative
instance. The Platonic division was, however, offered as the
scientific method of the school. A fragment of the comic poet
Epicrates gives a picture of it at work.<a name="fa13b" id="fa13b" href="#ft13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a> And the movement of
disjunction as truly has a place in the scientific specification of a
concept in all its differences as the linking of lower to higher in
syllogism. The two are complementary, and the reinstatement
of the disjunctive judgment to the more honourable rôle in
inference has been made by so notable a modern logician as
Lotze.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The correlative process of Combination is less elaborately
sketched, but in a luminous passage in the <i>Politicus</i> (§ 278),
in explaining by means of an example the nature and
use of examples, Plato represents it as the bringing
<span class="sidenote">Combination.</span>
of one and the same element seen in diverse settings to
conscious realization, with the result that it is viewed as a single
truth of which the terms compared are now accepted as the
differences. The learner is to be led forward to the unknown
by being made to hark back to more familiar groupings of the
alphabet of nature which he is coming to recognize with some
certainty. To lead on, <span class="grk" title="epagein">&#7952;&#960;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, is to refer back, <span class="grk" title="anagein">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>,<a name="fa14b" id="fa14b" href="#ft14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a> to what
has been correctly divined of the same elements in clearer cases.
Introduction to unfamiliar collocations follows upon this, and,
only so, is it possible finally to gather scattered examples into a
conspectus as instances of one idea or law. This is not only of
importance in the history of the terminology of logic, but
supplies a philosophy of induction.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Back of Plato&rsquo;s illustration and explanation of predication
and dialectical inference there lies not only the question of their
metaphysical grounding in the interconnexion of
ideas, but that of their epistemological presuppositions.
<span class="sidenote">Mental synthesis.</span>
This is dealt with in the Theaetetus (184<i>b</i> sqq.). The
manifold affections of sense are not simply aggregated in the
individual, like the heroes in the Trojan horse. There must be
convergence in a unitary principle, soul or consciousness, which
is that which really functions in perception, the senses and their
organs being merely its instruments. It is this unity of apperception
which enables us to combine the data of more than one
sense, to affirm reality, unreality, identity, difference, unity,
plurality and so forth, as also the good, the beautiful and their
contraries. Plato calls these pervasive factors in knowledge
<span class="grk" title="koina">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048;</span>, and describes them as developed by the soul in virtue of
its own activity. They are objects of its reflection and made
explicit in the few with pains and gradually.<a name="fa15b" id="fa15b" href="#ft15b"><span class="sp">15</span></a> That they are not,
however, psychological or acquired categories, due to &ldquo;the
workmanship of the mind&rdquo; as conceived by Locke, is obvious
from their attribution to the structure of mind<a name="fa16b" id="fa16b" href="#ft16b"><span class="sp">16</span></a> and from their
correlation with immanent principles of the objective order.
Considered from the epistemological point of view, they are the
implicit presuppositions of the construction or <span class="grk" title="syllogismos">&#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span><a name="fa17b" id="fa17b" href="#ft17b"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
in which knowledge consists. But as ideas,<a name="fa18b" id="fa18b" href="#ft18b"><span class="sp">18</span></a> though of a type
quite apart,<a name="fa19b" id="fa19b" href="#ft19b"><span class="sp">19</span></a> they have also a constitutive application to reality.
Accordingly, of the selected &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; by means of which the
interpenetration of ideas is expounded in the <i>Sophistes</i>, only
motion and rest, the ultimate &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; in the physical world,
have no counterparts in the &ldquo;categories&rdquo; of the <i>Theaetetus</i>.
In his doctrine as to <span class="grk" title="en to poioun">&#7957;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> or <span class="grk" title="krinon">&#954;&#961;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>, as generally in that
of the activity of the <span class="grk" title="nous apathês">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#962;</span>, Aristotle in the <i>de Anima</i><a name="fa20b" id="fa20b" href="#ft20b"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
is in the main but echoing the teaching of Plato.<a name="fa21b" id="fa21b" href="#ft21b"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page899" id="page899"></a>899</span></p>

<p class="pt1 center">ii. <i>Aristotle.</i></p>

<p>Plato&rsquo;s episodic use of logical distinctions<a name="fa22b" id="fa22b" href="#ft22b"><span class="sp">22</span></a> is frequent. His
recourse to such logical analysis as would meet the requirements
of the problem in hand<a name="fa23b" id="fa23b" href="#ft23b"><span class="sp">23</span></a> is not rare. In the &ldquo;dialectical&rdquo;
dialogues the question of method and of the justification of its
postulates attains at least a like prominence with the ostensible
subject matter. There is even formal recognition of the fact
that to advance in dialectic is a greater thing than to bring any
special inquiry to a successful issue.<a name="fa24b" id="fa24b" href="#ft24b"><span class="sp">24</span></a> But to the end there is a lack
of interest in, and therefore a relative immaturity of, technique
as such. In the forcing atmosphere, however, of that age of
controversy, seed such as that sown in the master&rsquo;s treatment
of the uttered <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span><a name="fa25b" id="fa25b" href="#ft25b"><span class="sp">25</span></a> quickly germinated. Plato&rsquo;s successors in
the Academy must have developed a system of grammatico-logical
categories which Aristotle could make his own. Else
much of his criticism of Platonic doctrine<a name="fa26b" id="fa26b" href="#ft26b"><span class="sp">26</span></a> does, indeed, miss
fire. The gulf too, which the <i>Philebus</i><a name="fa27b" id="fa27b" href="#ft27b"><span class="sp">27</span></a> apparently left unbridged
between the sensuous apprehension of particulars and
the knowledge of universals of even minimum generality led
with Speusippus to a formula of knowledge in perception (<span class="grk" title="epistêmonikê
aisthêsis">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#945;&#7988;&#963;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>). These and like developments, which are to be
divined from references in the Aristotelian writings, jejune, and,
for the most part, of probable interpretation only, complete the
material which Aristotle could utilize when he seceded from the
Platonic school and embarked upon his own course of logical
inquiry.</p>

<p>This is embodied in the group of treatises later known as the
<i>Organon</i><a name="fa28b" id="fa28b" href="#ft28b"><span class="sp">28</span></a> and culminates in the theory of syllogism and of
demonstrative knowledge in the <i>Analytics</i>. All else
is finally subsidiary. In the well-known sentences
<span class="sidenote">Syllogism.</span>
with which the <i>Organon</i> closes<a name="fa29b" id="fa29b" href="#ft29b"><span class="sp">29</span></a> Aristotle has been supposed
to lay claim to the discovery of the principle of syllogism.
He at least claims to have been the first to dissect the
procedure of the debate-game, and the larger claim may be
thought to follow. In the course of inquiry into the formal
consequences from probable premises, the principle of mediation
or linking was so laid bare that the advance to the analytic
determination of the species and varieties of syllogism was
natural. Once embarked upon such an analysis, where valid
process from assured principles gave truth, Aristotle could
find little difficulty in determining the formula of demonstrative
knowledge or science. It must be grounded in principles of
assured certainty and must demonstrate its conclusions with
the use of such middle or linking terms only as it is possible to
equate with the real ground or cause in the object of knowledge.
Hence the account of axioms and of definitions, both of substances
and of derivative attributes. Hence the importance of determining
how first principles are established. It is, then, a fair
working hypothesis as to the structure of the <i>Organon</i> to place
the <i>Topics</i>, which deal with dialectical reasoning, before the
<i>Analytics</i>.<a name="fa30b" id="fa30b" href="#ft30b"><span class="sp">30</span></a> Of the remaining treatises nothing of fundamental
import depends on their order. One, however, the <i>Categories</i>,
may be regarded with an ancient commentator,<a name="fa31b" id="fa31b" href="#ft31b"><span class="sp">31</span></a> as preliminary
to the dialectical inquiry in the <i>Topics</i>. The other, on thought
as expressed in language (<span class="grk" title="Peri ermêneias">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7952;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>) is possibly spurious,
though in any case a compilation of the Aristotelian school.
If genuine, its naïve theory that thought copies things and other
features of its contents would tend to place it among the earliest
works of the philosopher.</p>

<p>Production in the form of a series of relatively self-contained
treatises accounts for the absence of a name and general definition
of their common field of inquiry. A more important
lack which results is that of any clear intimation as
<span class="sidenote">The logical treatises.</span>
to the relation in which Aristotle supposed it to
stand to other disciplines. In his definite classification of the
sciences,<a name="fa32b" id="fa32b" href="#ft32b"><span class="sp">32</span></a> into First Philosophy, Mathematics and Physics,
it has no place. Its axioms, such as the law of contradiction,
belong to first philosophy, but the doctrine as a whole falls
neither under this head nor yet, though the thought has been
entertained, under that of mathematics, since logic orders
mathematical reasoning as well as all other. The speculative
sciences, indeed, are classified according to their relation to form,
pure, abstract or concrete, <i>i.e.</i> according to their objects. The
logical inquiry seems to be conceived as dealing with the thought
of which the objects are objects. It is to be regarded as a
propaedeutic,<a name="fa33b" id="fa33b" href="#ft33b"><span class="sp">33</span></a> which, although it is in contact with reality in and
through the metaphysical import of the axioms, or again in the
fact that the categories, though primarily taken as forms of
predication, must also be regarded as kinds of being, is not
directly concerned with object-reality, but with the determination
for the thinking subject of what constitutes the knowledge
correlative to being. Logic, therefore, is not classed as one, still
less as a branch of one, among the &rsquo;ologies, ontology not excepted.</p>

<p>The way in which logical doctrine is developed in the Aristotelian
treatises fits in with this view. Doubtless what we have
is in the main a reflex of the heuristic character of Aristotle&rsquo;s
own work as pioneer. But it at least satisfies the requirement
that the inquiry shall carry the plain man along with it. Actual
modes of expression are shown to embody distinctions which
average intelligence can easily recognize and will readily acknowledge,
though they may tend by progressive rectification fundamentally
to modify the assumption natural to the level of thought
from which he begins. Thus we start<a name="fa34b" id="fa34b" href="#ft34b"><span class="sp">34</span></a> from the point of view
of a world of separate persons and things, in which thought
mirrors these concrete realities, taken as ultimate subjects of
predicates. It is a world of communication of thought, where
persons as thinkers need to utter in language truths objectively
valid for the <i>mundus communis</i>. In these truths predicates are
accepted or rejected by subjects, and therefore depend on the
reflection of fact in <span class="grk" title="logoi">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span> (propositions). These are combinatory
of parts, attaching or detaching predicates, and so involving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page900" id="page900"></a>900</span>
subject, predicate and copula.<a name="fa35b" id="fa35b" href="#ft35b"><span class="sp">35</span></a> At this stage we are as much
concerned with speech-forms as the thought-forms of which they
are conventional symbols, with Plato&rsquo;s analysis, for instance,
into a noun and a verb, whose connotation of time is as yet a
difficulty. The universal of this stage is the universal of fact,
what is recognized as predicable of a plurality of subjects. The
dialectical doctrine of judgment as the declaration of one member
of a disjunction by contradiction, which is later so important, is
struggling with one of its initial difficulties,<a name="fa36b" id="fa36b" href="#ft36b"><span class="sp">36</span></a> viz. the contingency
of particular events future, the solution of which remains imperfect.<a name="fa37b" id="fa37b" href="#ft37b"><span class="sp">37</span></a></p>

<p>The doctrine of the <i>Categories</i> is still on the same level of
thought,<a name="fa38b" id="fa38b" href="#ft38b"><span class="sp">38</span></a> though its grammatico-logical analysis is the more
advanced one which had probably been developed by
the Academy before Aristotle came to think of his
<span class="sidenote">The Categories.</span>
friends there as &ldquo;them&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;us.&rdquo; It is
what in one direction gave the now familiar classification of
parts of speech, in the other that of thought-categories underlying
them. If we abstract from any actual combination of
subject and predicate and proceed to determine the types of predicate
asserted in simple propositions of fact, we have on the one
hand a subject which is never object, a &ldquo;first substance&rdquo; or concrete
thing, of which may be predicated in the first place &ldquo;second
substance&rdquo; expressing that it is a member of a concrete class,
and in the second place quantity, quality, correlation, action
and the like. The list follows the forms of the Greek language so
closely that a category emerges appropriated to the use of the
perfect tense of the middle voice to express the relation of the
subject to a garb that it dons. In all this the individual is the
sole self-subsistent reality. Truth and error are about the
individual and attach or detach predicates correctly and incorrectly.
There is no committal to the metaphysics in the light
of which the logical inquiry is at last to find its complete justification.
The point of view is to be modified profoundly by what
follows&mdash;by the doctrine of the class-concept behind the class,
of the form or idea as the constitutive formula of a substance,
or, again, by the requirement that an essential attribute must
be grounded in the nature or essence of the substance of which
it is predicated, and that such attributes alone are admissible
predicates from the point of view of the strict ideal of science.
But we are still on the ground of common opinion, and these
doctrines are not yet laid down as fundamental to the development.</p>

<p>Dialectic then, though it may prove to be the ultimate method
of establishing principles in philosophy,<a name="fa39b" id="fa39b" href="#ft39b"><span class="sp">39</span></a> starts from probable
and conceded premises,<a name="fa40b" id="fa40b" href="#ft40b"><span class="sp">40</span></a> and deals with them only in
the light of common principles such as may be reasonably
<span class="sidenote">The Topics.</span>
appealed to or easily established against challenge.
To the expert, in any study which involves contingent matter,
<i>i.e.</i> an irreducible element of indetermination, <i>e.g.</i> to the physician,
there is a specific form of this, but the reflection that this is so is
something of an afterthought. We start with what is prima facie
given, to return upon it from the ground of principles clarified by
the sifting process of dialectic<a name="fa41b" id="fa41b" href="#ft41b"><span class="sp">41</span></a> and certified by <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>. The <i>Topics</i>
deal with dialectic and constitute an anatomy of argumentation,
or, according to what seems to be Aristotle&rsquo;s own metaphor, a
survey of the tactical vantage-points (<span class="grk" title="topoi">&#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#953;</span>) for the conflict of
wits in which the prize is primarily victory, though it is a barren
victory unless it is also knowledge. It is in this treatise that
what have been called &ldquo;the conceptual categories&rdquo;<a name="fa42b" id="fa42b" href="#ft42b"><span class="sp">42</span></a> emerge,
viz. the <i>predicables</i>, or heads of predication as it is analysed in
relation to the provisional theory of definition that dialectic
allows and requires. A predicate either is expressive of the
essence or part of the essence of the subject, viz. that original
group of mutually underivable attributes of which the absence
of any one destroys its right to the class-name, or it is not.
Either it is convertible with the subject or it is not. Here then
judgment, though still viewed as combinatory, has the types
which belong to coherent systems of implication discriminated
from those that predicate coincidence or accident, <i>i.e.</i> any
happening not even derivatively essential from the point of view
of the grouping in which the subject has found a place. In the
theory of dialectic any predicate may be suggested for a subject,
and if not affirmed of it, must be denied of it, if not denied must
be affirmed. The development of a theory of the ground on
which subjects claim their predicates and disown alien predicates
could not be long postponed. In practical dialectic the unlimited
possibility was reduced to manageable proportions in
virtue of the groundwork of received opinion upon which the
operation proceeded. It is in the <i>Topics</i>, further, that we clearly
have a first treatment of syllogism as formal implication, with
the suggestion that advance must be made to a view of its use
for material implication from true and necessary principles.
It is in the <i>Topics</i>,<a name="fa43b" id="fa43b" href="#ft43b"><span class="sp">43</span></a> again, that we have hints at the devices of an
inductive process, which, as dialectical, throw the burden of
producing contradictory instances upon the other party to the
discussion. In virtue of the common-stock of opinion among
the interlocutors and their potentially controlling audience,
this process was more valuable than appears on the face of
things. Obviously tentative, and with limits and ultimate interpretation
to be determined elsewhere, it failed to bear fruit till
the Renaissance, and then by the irony of fate to the discrediting
of Aristotle. In any case, however, definition, syllogism,
induction all invited further determination, especially if they
were to take their place in a doctrine of truth or knowledge.
The problem of analytic, <i>i.e.</i> of the resolution of the various
forms of inference into their equivalents in that grouping of terms
or premises which was most obviously cogent, was a legacy of the
<i>Topics</i>. The debate-game had sought for diversion and found
truth, and truth raised the logical problem on a different plane.</p>

<p>At first the problem of formal analysis only. We proceed
with the talk of instances and concern ourselves first with
relations of inclusion and exclusion. The question is
as to membership of a class, and the dominant formula
<span class="sidenote">Class concept.</span>
is the <i>dictum de omni et nullo</i>. Until the view of the
individual units with which we are so far familiar has undergone
radical revision, the primary inquiry must be into the forms of
a class-calculus. Individuals fall into groups in virtue of the
possession of certain predicates. Does one group include, or
exclude, or intersect another with which it is compared? We are
clearly in the field of the diagrams of the text-books, and much of
the phraseology is based upon an original graphic representation
in extension. The middle term, though conceived as an intermediary
or linking term, gets its name as intermediate in a
homogeneous scheme of quantity, where it cannot be of narrower
extension than the subject nor wider than the predicate of the
conclusion.<a name="fa44b" id="fa44b" href="#ft44b"><span class="sp">44</span></a> It is also, as Aristotle adds,<a name="fa45b" id="fa45b" href="#ft45b"><span class="sp">45</span></a> middle in position in
the syllogism that concludes to a universal affirmative.<a href="#ft45b"><span class="sp">45</span></a> Again,
so long as we keep to the syllogism as complete in itself and
without reference to its place in the great structure of knowledge,
the nerve of proof cannot be conceived in other than a formal
manner. In analytic we work with an ethos different from that
of dialectic. We presume truth and not probability or concession,
but a true conclusion can follow from false premises, and
it is only in the attempt to derive the premises in turn from
their grounds that we unmask the deception. The passage to
the conception of system is still required. The <i>Prior Analytics</i>
<span class="sidenote">The Prior Analytics.</span>
then are concerned with a formal logic to
be knit into a system of knowledge of the real only in
virtue of a formula which is at this stage still to seek.
The forms of syllogism, however, are tracked successfully through
their figures, <i>i.e.</i> through the positions of the middle term that
Aristotle recognizes as of actual employment, and all their moods,
<i>i.e.</i> all differences of affirmative and negative, universal and
particular within the figures, the cogent or legitimate forms are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page901" id="page901"></a>901</span>
alone left standing, and the formal doctrine of syllogism is complete.
Syllogism already defined<a name="fa46b" id="fa46b" href="#ft46b"><span class="sp">46</span></a> becomes through exhibition
in its valid forms clear in its principle. It is a speech-and-thought-form
(<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>) in which certain matters being posited
something other than the matters posited necessarily results
because of them, and, though it still needs to receive a deeper
meaning when presumed truth gives way to necessary truth of
premises, the notion of the class to that of the class-concept,
collective fact to universal law, its formal claim is manifest.
&ldquo;Certain matters being posited.&rdquo; Subject and predicate not
already seen to be conjoined must be severally known to be in
relation with that which joins them, so that more than one
direct conjunction must be given. &ldquo;Of necessity.&rdquo; If what
are to be conjoined are severally in relation to a common third
it does perforce relate or conjoin them. &ldquo;Something other.&rdquo;
The conjunction was by hypothesis not given, and is a new
result by no means to be reached, apart from direct perception
save by use of at least two given conjunctions. &ldquo;Because of
them,&rdquo; therefore. Yet so long as the class-view is prominent,
there is a suggestion of a begging of the question. The class is
either constituted by enumeration of its members, and, passing
by the difficulty involved in the thought of &ldquo;its&rdquo; members,
is an empirical universal of fact merely, or it is grounded in the
class-concept. In the first case it is a formal scheme which helps
knowledge and the theory of knowledge not at all. We need
then to develop the alternative, and to pass from the external
aspect of all-ness to the intrinsic ground of it in the universal
<span class="grk" title="kath' auto kai ê auto">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8125; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8087; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;</span>, which, whatsoever the assistance it receives
from induction in some sense of the word, in the course of its
development for the individual mind, is secured against dependence
on instances by the decisive fiat or guarantee of <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>,
insight into the systematic nexus of things. The conception of
linkage needs to be deepened by the realization of the middle
term as the ground of nexus in a real order which is also rational.</p>

<p>Aristotle&rsquo;s solution of the paradox of inference, viz. of the fact
that in one sense to go beyond what is in the premises is fallacy,
<span class="sidenote">Problem of inference.</span>
while in another sense not to go beyond them is futility,
lies in his formula of implicit and explicit, potential
and actual.<a name="fa47b" id="fa47b" href="#ft47b"><span class="sp">47</span></a> The real nexus underlying the thought-process
is to be articulated in the light of the voucher by intelligence
as to the truth of the principles of the various departments
of knowledge which we call sciences, and at the ideal limit it is
possible to transform syllogism into systematic presentation, so
that, differently written down, it is definition. But for human
thought sense, with its accidental setting in matter itself incognizable
<span class="sidenote">Nous.</span>
is always with us. The activity of <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> is never
so perfectly realized as to merge implication in intuition.
Syllogism must indeed be objective, <i>i.e.</i> valid for any thinker,
but it is also a process in the medium of individual thinking,
whereby new truth is reached. A man may know that mules
are sterile and that the beast before him is a mule, and yet believe
her to be in foal &ldquo;not viewing the several truths in connexion.&rdquo;<a name="fa48b" id="fa48b" href="#ft48b"><span class="sp">48</span></a>
The doctrine, then, that the universal premise contains the conclusion
not otherwise than potentially is with Aristotle cardinal.
The datum of sense is only retained through the universal.<a name="fa49b" id="fa49b" href="#ft49b"><span class="sp">49</span></a>
It is possible to take a universal view with some at least of the
particular instances left uninvestigated.<a name="fa50b" id="fa50b" href="#ft50b"><span class="sp">50</span></a> Recognition that the
class-concept is applicable may be independent of knowledge
of much that it involves. Knowledge of the implications of it
does not depend on observation of all members of the class.
Syllogism as formula for the exhibition of truth attained, and
construction or what not as the instrumental process by which
we reach the truth, have with writers since Hegel and Herbart
tended to fall apart. Aristotle&rsquo;s view is other. Both are syllogisms,
though in different points of view. For this reason, if
for no other, the conception of movement from the potential
possession of knowledge to its actualization remains indispensable.
Whether this is explanation or description, a problem or its
solution, is of course another matter.</p>

<p>In the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> the syllogism is brought into
decisive connexion with the real by being set within a system
in which its function is that of material implication
from principles which are primary, immediate and
<span class="sidenote">Posterior Analytics.</span>
necessary truths. Hitherto the assumption of the
probable as true rather than as what will be conceded
in debate<a name="fa51b" id="fa51b" href="#ft51b"><span class="sp">51</span></a> has been the main distinction of the standpoint
of analytic from that of dialectic. But the true is true only
in reference to a coherent system in which it is an immediate
ascertainment of <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, or to be deduced from a ground which
is such. The ideal of science or demonstrative knowledge is
to exhibit as flowing from the definitions and postulates of a
science, from its special principles, by the help only of axioms
or principles common to all knowledge, and these not as premises
but as guiding rules, all the properties of the subject-matter,
<i>i.e.</i> all the predicates that belong to it in its own nature. In
the case of any subject-kind, its definition and its existence
being avouched by <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;heavenly body&rdquo; for example, the
problem is, given the fact of a non-self-subsistent characteristic
of it, such as the eclipse of the said body, to find a ground, a
<span class="grk" title="meson">&#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span> which expressed the <span class="grk" title="aition">&#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, in virtue of which the
adjectival concept can be exhibited as belonging to the subject-concept
<span class="grk" title="kath auto">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#8125; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8056;</span> in the strictly adequate sense of the phrase
in which it means also <span class="grk" title="hê auto">&#8086; &#945;&#8017;&#964;&#8056;</span>.<a name="fa52b" id="fa52b" href="#ft52b"><span class="sp">52</span></a> We are under the necessity
then of revising the point of view of the syllogism of all-ness.
We discard the conception of the universal as a predicate applicable
to a plurality, or even to all, of the members of a group.
To know merely <span class="grk" title="kata pantos">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> is not to know, save accidentally.
The exhaustive judgment, if attainable, could not be known
to be exhaustive. The universal is the ground of the empirical
&ldquo;all&rdquo; and not conversely. A formula such as the equality of
the interior angles of a triangle to two right angles is only
scientifically known when it is not of isosceles or scalene triangle
that it is known, nor even of all the several types of triangle
collectively, but as a predicate of triangle recognized as the
widest class-concept of which it is true, the first stage in the
progressive differentiation of figure at which it can be asserted.<a name="fa53b" id="fa53b" href="#ft53b"><span class="sp">53</span></a></p>

<p>Three points obviously need development, the nature of
definition, its connexion with the syllogism in which the middle
term is cause or ground, and the way in which we have assurance
of our principles.</p>

<p>Definition is either of the subject-kind or of the property that
is grounded in it. Of the self-subsistent definition is <span class="grk" title="ousias tis
gnôrismos">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span><a name="fa54b" id="fa54b" href="#ft54b"><span class="sp">54</span></a> by exposition of genus and differentia.<a name="fa55b" id="fa55b" href="#ft55b"><span class="sp">55</span></a> It
is indemonstrable. It presumes the reality of its subject
<span class="sidenote">Definition.</span>
in a postulate of existence. It belongs to the principles
of demonstration. <i>Summa genera</i> and groups below <i>infimae
species</i> are indefinable. The former are susceptible of
elucidation by indication of what falls under them. The latter
are only describable by their accidents. There can here be
no true differentia. The artificiality of the limit to the articulation
of species was one of the points to which the downfall of
Aristotle&rsquo;s influence was largely due. Of a non-self-subsistent
or attributive conception definition in its highest attainable
form is a recasting of the syllogism, in which it was shown that
the attribute was grounded in the substance or self-subsistent
subject of which it is. Eclipse of the moon, <i>e.g.</i> is privation of
light from the moon by the interposition of the earth between
it and the sun. In the scientific syllogism the interposition of
the earth is the middle term, the cause or &ldquo;because&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="dioti">&#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;</span>), the
residue of the definition is conclusion. The difference then is
in verbal expression, way of putting, inflexion.<a name="fa56b" id="fa56b" href="#ft56b"><span class="sp">56</span></a> If we pluck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page902" id="page902"></a>902</span>
the fruit of the conclusion, severing its nexus with the stock
from which it springs, we have an imperfect form of definition,
while, if further we abandon all idea of making it adequate
by exhibition of its ground, we have, with still the same form of
words, a definition merely nominal or lexicographical. In the
aporematic treatment of the relation of definition and syllogism
identical as to one form and in one view, distinct as to another
form and in another view, much of Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion consists.
<span class="sidenote">The middle term.</span>
The rest is a consideration of scientific inquiry as
converging in <span class="grk" title="mesou zêtêsis">&#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#965; &#950;&#942;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, the investigation of
the link or &ldquo;because&rdquo; as ground in the nature of
things. <span class="grk" title="To men gar aition to meson">&#932;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#945;&#7988;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span><a name="fa57b" id="fa57b" href="#ft57b"><span class="sp">57</span></a> real ground and
thought link fall together. The advance from syllogism as
formal implication is a notable one. It is not enough to have
for middle term a <i>causa cognoscendi</i> merely. We must have a
<i>causa essendi</i>. The planets are near, and we know it by their
not twinkling,<a name="fa58b" id="fa58b" href="#ft58b"><span class="sp">58</span></a> but science must conceive their nearness as the
cause of their not twinkling and make the <i>prius</i> in the real
order the middle term of its syllogism. In this irreversible
catena proceeding from ground to consequent, we have left
far behind such things as the formal parity of genus and differentia
considered as falling under the same predicable,<a name="fa59b" id="fa59b" href="#ft59b"><span class="sp">59</span></a> and hence
justified in part Porphyry&rsquo;s divergence from the scheme of
predicables. We need devices, indeed, to determine priority
or superior claim to be &ldquo;better known absolutely or in the
order of nature,&rdquo; but on the whole the problem is fairly faced.<a name="fa60b" id="fa60b" href="#ft60b"><span class="sp">60</span></a></p>

<p>Of science Aristotle takes for his examples sometimes celestial
physics, more often geometry or arithmetic, sometimes a concrete
science, <i>e.g.</i> botany.<a name="fa61b" id="fa61b" href="#ft61b"><span class="sp">61</span></a> In the field of pure form, free
from the disconcerting surprises of sensible matter and so of
absolute necessity, no difficulty arises as to the deducibility
of the whole body of a science from its first principles. In the
sphere of abstract form, mathematics, the like may be allowed,
abstraction being treated as an elimination of matter from
the <span class="grk" title="synolon">&#963;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> by one act. When we take into account relative
matter, however, and traces of a conception of abstraction as
admitting of degree,<a name="fa62b" id="fa62b" href="#ft62b"><span class="sp">62</span></a> the question is not free from difficulty.
In the sphere of the concrete sciences where law obtains only
<span class="grk" title="hôs epi to polu">&#8033;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#8058;</span> this ideal of science can clearly find only a relative
satisfaction with large reserves. In any case, however, the
problem as to first principles remains fundamental.</p>

<p>If we reject the infinite regress and the circle in proof (<i>circulus
in probando</i>) which resolves itself ultimately into proving A by B
and B by A,<a name="fa63b" id="fa63b" href="#ft63b"><span class="sp">63</span></a> we are confronted by the need for
principles of two kinds, those which condition all search
<span class="sidenote">Formal and scientific principles.</span>
for truth, and those which are the peculiar or proper
principles of special sciences, their &ldquo;positions,&rdquo; viz. the
definitions of their subjects and the postulates of the existence of
these. All are indemonstrable and cannot be less sure than the
body of doctrine that flows from them. They must indeed be
recognized as true, primary, causative and the like. But<a name="fa64b" id="fa64b" href="#ft64b"><span class="sp">64</span></a> they
are not congenitally present in the individual in a determinate
shape. The doctrine of latency is mystical and savours of
Plato&rsquo;s reminiscence (<i>anamnesis</i>). Yet they must have something
to develop from, and thereupon Aristotle gives an account
of a process in the psychological mechanism which he illustrates
by comparative psychology, wherein a <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> or meaning emerges,
<span class="sidenote">Induction and dialectic.</span>
a &ldquo;first&rdquo; universal recognized by induction. Yet
<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, intelligence, is the principle of first principles.
It is infallible, while, whatever the case with perception
of the special sensibles,<a name="fa65b" id="fa65b" href="#ft65b"><span class="sp">65</span></a> the process which combines
particulars is not. On the side of induction we find that experience
is said to give the specific principles,<a name="fa66b" id="fa66b" href="#ft66b"><span class="sp">66</span></a> &ldquo;the phenomena
being apprehended in sufficiency.&rdquo; On the side of intuition,
self-evidence of scientific principles is spoken of.<a name="fa67b" id="fa67b" href="#ft67b"><span class="sp">67</span></a> Yet dialectic
is auxiliary and of methodological importance in their establishment.<a name="fa68b" id="fa68b" href="#ft68b"><span class="sp">68</span></a>
Mutually limiting statements occur almost or quite
side by side. We cannot take first principles &ldquo;as the bare
precipitate of a progressively refined analysis&rdquo;<a name="fa69b" id="fa69b" href="#ft69b"><span class="sp">69</span></a> nor on the
other as constitutive a priori forms. The solution seems to lie
in the conception of a process that has a double aspect. On
the one hand we have confrontation with fact, in which, in
virtue of the rational principle which is the final cause of the
phenomenal order, intelligence will find satisfaction. On the
other we have a stage at which the rational but as yet not
reasoned concepts developed in the medium of the psychological
mechanism are subjected to processes of reflective comparison
and analysis, and, with some modification, maintained against
challenge, till at length the ultimate universals emerge, which
rational insight can posit as certain, and the whole hierarchy of
concepts from the &ldquo;first&rdquo; universals to <span class="grk" title="ta amerê">&#964;&#8048; &#7936;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#8134;</span> are intuited
in a coherent system. Aristotle&rsquo;s terminology is highly technical,
but, as has often been observed, not therefore clear. Here two
words at least are ambiguous, &ldquo;principle&rdquo; and &ldquo;induction.&rdquo; By
the first he means any starting-point, &ldquo;that from which the
matter in question is primarily to be known,&rdquo;<a name="fa70b" id="fa70b" href="#ft70b"><span class="sp">70</span></a> particular facts
therefore, premises, and what not. What then is meant by principles
when we ask in the closing chapter of his logic how they
become known? The data of sense are clearly not the principles
in question here. The premises of scientific syllogisms may
equally be dismissed. Where they are not derivative they
clearly are definitions or immediate transcripts from definitions.
There remain, then, primary definitions and the postulates of their
realization, and the axioms or common principles, &ldquo;which he
must needs have who is to reach any knowledge.&rdquo;<a name="fa71b" id="fa71b" href="#ft71b"><span class="sp">71</span></a> In the case
of the former, special each to its own science, Aristotle may be
thought to hold that they are the product of the psychological
mechanism, but are ascertained only when they have faced
the fire of a critical dialectic and have been accepted from
the point of view of the integral rationality of the system of concepts.
Axioms, on the other hand, in which the sciences interconnect<a name="fa72b" id="fa72b" href="#ft72b"><span class="sp">72</span></a>
through the employment of them in a parity of relation,
seem to be implicit indeed in the psychological mechanism, but
to come to a kind of explicitness in the first reflective reaction
upon it, and without reference to any particular content of it.
They are not to be used as premises but as immanent laws of
thought, save only when an inference from true or admitted
premises and correct in form is challenged. The challenge must
be countered in a <i>reductio ad impossibile</i> in which the dilemma
is put. Either this conclusion or the denial of rationality.
Even these principles, however, may get a greater explicitness
by dialectical treatment.<a name="fa73b" id="fa73b" href="#ft73b"><span class="sp">73</span></a> The relation, then, of the two orders
of principle to the psychological mechanism is different. The
kind of warrant that intelligence can give to specific principles
falls short of infallibility. Celestial physics, with its pure forms
and void of all matter save extension, is not such an exemplary
science after all. Rationality is continuous throughout. A
<span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> emerges with some beings in direct sequence upon the
persistence of impressions.<a name="fa74b" id="fa74b" href="#ft74b"><span class="sp">74</span></a> Sense is of the &ldquo;first&rdquo; universal,
the form, though not of the ultimate universal. The rally from
the rout in Aristotle&rsquo;s famous metaphor is of units that already
belong together, that are of the same regiment or order. On
the other hand, rationality has two stages. In the one it is
relatively immersed in sense, in the other relatively free. The
same break is to be found in the conception of the relation of
receptive to active mind in the treatise <i>Of the Soul</i>.<a name="fa75b" id="fa75b" href="#ft75b"><span class="sp">75</span></a> The one
is impressed by things and receives their form without their
matter. The other is free from impression. It thinks its
system of concepts freely on the occasion of the affections of the
receptivity. Aristotle is fond of declaring that knowledge
is of the universal, while existence or reality is individual. It
seems to follow that the cleavage between knowledge and reality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page903" id="page903"></a>903</span>
is not bridged by the function of <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> in relation to &ldquo;induction.&rdquo;
What is known is not real, and what is real is not known. The
<span class="sidenote">Knowledge and reality.</span>
<i>nodus</i><a name="fa76b" id="fa76b" href="#ft76b"><span class="sp">76</span></a> has its cause in the double sense of the word
&ldquo;universal&rdquo; and a possible solution in the doctrine
of <span class="grk" title="eidos">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>. The &ldquo;form&rdquo; of a thing constitutes it
what it is, and at the same time, therefore, is
constitutive of the group to which it belongs. It has both individual
and universal reference. The individual is known
in the <span class="grk" title="eidos">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>, which is also the first universal in which by analysis
higher universals are discoverable. These are predicates of the
object known, ways of knowing it, rather than the object itself.
The suggested solution removes certain difficulties, but scarcely
all. On seeing Callias my perception is of man, not Callias,
or even man-Callias. The recognition of the individual is a
matter of his accidents, to which even sex belongs, and the gap
from lowest universal to individual may still be conceived as
unbridged. It is in induction, which claims to start from
particulars and end in universals,<a name="fa77b" id="fa77b" href="#ft77b"><span class="sp">77</span></a> that we must, if anywhere
within the confines of logical inquiry, expect to find the required
bridge. The Aristotelian conception of induction, however, is
somewhat ambiguous. He had abandoned for the most part
<span class="sidenote">Conclusions as to induction.</span>
the Platonic sense of the corresponding verb, viz. to
lead forward to the as yet unknown, and his substitute
is not quite clear. It is scarcely the military metaphor.
The adducing of a witness for which he uses the verb<a name="fa78b" id="fa78b" href="#ft78b"><span class="sp">78</span></a>
is not an idea that covers all the uses.<a name="fa79b" id="fa79b" href="#ft79b"><span class="sp">79</span></a> Perhaps confrontation
with facts is the general meaning. But how does he conceive
of its operation? There is in the first place the action of the
psychological mechanism in the process from discriminative
sense upwards wherein we realize &ldquo;first&rdquo; universals.<a name="fa80b" id="fa80b" href="#ft80b"><span class="sp">80</span></a> This
is clearly an unreflective, pre-logical process, not altogether
lighted up by our retrojection upon it of our view of dialectical
induction based thereon. The immanent rationality of this
first form, in virtue of which at the stage when intelligence
acts freely on the occasion of the datum supplied it recognizes
continuity with its own self-conscious process, is what gives
the dialectical type its meaning. Secondly we have this dialectical
&ldquo;induction as to particulars by grouping of similars&rdquo;<a name="fa81b" id="fa81b" href="#ft81b"><span class="sp">81</span></a>
whose liability to rebuttal by an exception has been already
noted in connexion with the limits of dialectic. This is the
incomplete induction by simple enumeration which has so
often been laughed to scorn. It is a heuristic process liable
to failure, and its application by a nation of talkers even to
physics where non-expert opinion is worthless somewhat discredited
it. Yet it was the fundamental form of induction
as it was conceived throughout the scholastic period. Thirdly
we have the limiting cases of this in the inductive syllogism
<span class="grk" title="dia pantôn">&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>,<a name="fa82b" id="fa82b" href="#ft82b"><span class="sp">82</span></a> a syllogism in the third figure concluding universally,
and yet valid because the copula expresses equivalence, and in
analogy<a name="fa83b" id="fa83b" href="#ft83b"><span class="sp">83</span></a> in which, it has been well said, instances are weighed
and not counted. In the former it has been noted<a name="fa84b" id="fa84b" href="#ft84b"><span class="sp">84</span></a> that
Aristotle&rsquo;s illustration does not combine particular facts into
a lowest concept, but specific concepts into a generic concept,
and<a name="fa85b" id="fa85b" href="#ft85b"><span class="sp">85</span></a> that in the construction of definite inductions the ruling
thought with Aristotle is already, though vaguely, that of
causal relation. It appears safer, notwithstanding, to take the
less subtle interpretation<a name="fa86b" id="fa86b" href="#ft86b"><span class="sp">86</span></a> that dialectical induction struggling
with instances is formally justified only at the limit, and that
this, where we have exhausted and know that we have exhausted
the cases, is in regard to individual subjects rarely and accidentally
reached, so that we perforce illustrate rather from the
definite class-concepts falling under a higher notion. After
all, Aristotle must have had means by which he reached the
conclusions that horses are long-lived and lack gall. It is only
then in the rather mystical relation of <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> to the first type of
induction as the process of the psychological mechanism that an
indication of the direction in which the bridge from individual
being to universal knowledge is to be found can be held to lie.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to justify the great place assigned to
Aristotle in the history of logic. Without pressing metaphysical
formulae in logic proper, he analysed formal implication
grounded implication as a mode of knowledge
<span class="sidenote">Summary.</span>
in the rationality of the real, and developed a justificatory
metaphysic. He laid down the programme which the after
history of logic was to carry out. We have of course abandoned
particular logical positions. This is especially to be noted in the
theory of the proposition. The individualism with which he
starts, howsoever afterwards mitigated by his doctrine of <span class="grk" title="to ti
ên einai">&#964;&#8056; &#964;&#8054; &#7974;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> or <span class="grk" title="eidos">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> constituting the individual in a system of
intelligible relations, confined him in an inadmissible way to
the subject-attribute formula. He could not recognize such
vocables as the impersonals for what they were, and had perforce
to ignore the logical significance of purely reciprocal judgments,
such as those of equality. There was necessarily a &ldquo;sense&rdquo;
or direction in every proposition, with more than the purely
psychological import that the advance was from the already
mastered and familiar taken as relatively stable, to the new and
strange. Many attributes, too, were predicable, even to the
end, in an external and accidental way, not being derivable from
the essence of the subject. The thought of contingency was too
easily applied to these attributes, and an unsatisfactory treatment
of modality followed. It is indeed the doctrine of the intractability
of matter to form that lies at the base of the paradox
as to the disparateness of knowledge and the real already noted.
On the one hand Aristotle by his doctrine of matter admitted
a surd into his system. On the other, he assigned to <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> with
its insight into rationality too high a function with regard to
the concrete in which the surd was present, a power to certify
the truth of scientific principles. The example of Aristotle&rsquo;s
view of celestial physics as a science of pure forms exhibits
both points. On the Copernican change the heavenly bodies
were recognized as concrete and yet subject to calculable law.
Intelligence had warranted false principles. The moral is that
of the story of the heel of Achilles.</p>

<p>To return to logic proper. The Aristotelian theory of the
universal of science as secure from dependence on its instances
and the theory of linking in syllogism remain a heritage for all
later logic, whether accepted in precisely Aristotle&rsquo;s formula
or no. It is because the intervening centuries had the Aristotelian
basis to work on, sometimes in reduced quantity and corrupt
form, but always in some quantity and some form, that the
rest of our logical tradition is what it is. We stand upon his
shoulders.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center">iii. <i>Later Greek Logic.</i></p>

<p>After Aristotle we have, as regards logic, what the verdict of after
times has rightly characterized as an age of <i>Epigoni</i>. So far as the
Aristotelian framework is accepted we meet only minor corrections and
extensions of a formal kind. If there is conscious and purposed
divergence from Aristotle, inquiry moves, on the whole, within the
circle of ideas where Aristotelianism had fought its fight and won
its victory. Where new conceptions emerge, the imperfection of
the instruments, mechanical and methodological, of the sciences
renders them unfruitful, until their rediscovery in a later age. We
have activity without advance, diversity without development.
Attempts at comprehensiveness end in the compromises of eclecticism.</p>

<p>Illustrations are not far to seek. Theophrastus and in general
the elder Peripatetics, before the rise of new schools with new lines
of cleavage and new interests had led to new antagonisms
and new alliances, do not break away from the Aristotelian
<span class="sidenote">The Peripatetics.</span>
metaphysic. Their interests, however, lie in the sublunary
sciences in which the substantive achievement of the school was to
be found. With Theophrastus, accordingly, in his botanical inquiries,
for example, the alternatives of classification, the normal
sequence of such and such a character upon such another, the
conclusion of rational probability, are what counts. It is perhaps
not wholly fanciful to connect with this attitude the fact that
Aristotle&rsquo;s pupils dealt with a surer hand than the master with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page904" id="page904"></a>904</span>
conclusions from premises of unlike modality, and that a formal
advance of some significance attributable to Theophrastus and
Eudemus is the doctrine of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms.</p>

<p>The Stoics are of more importance. Despite the fact that their
philosophic interests lay rather in ethics and physics, their activity
in what they classified as the third department of speculation
was enormous and has at least left ineffaceable
<span class="sidenote">The Stoics.</span>
traces on the terminology of philosophy. Logic is their
word, and consciousness, impression and other technical words come
to us, at least as technical words, from Roman Stoicism. Even
inference, though apparently not a classical word, throws back to
the Stoic name for a conclusion.<a name="fa87b" id="fa87b" href="#ft87b"><span class="sp">87</span></a> In the second place, it is in the
form in which it was raised in connexion with the individualistic
theory of perception with which the Stoics started, that one question
of fundamental importance, viz. that of the criterion of truth,
exercised its influence on the individualists of the Renaissance.
Perception, in the view of the Stoics, at its highest both revealed and
guaranteed the being of its object. Its hold upon the object involved
the discernment that it could but be that which it purported
to be. Such &ldquo;psychological certainty&rdquo; was denied by their agnostic
opponents, and in the history of Stoicism we have apparently a
modification of the doctrine of <span class="grk" title="phantasia katalêptikê">&#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;</span> with a view
to meet the critics, an approximation to a recognition that the
primary conviction might meet with a counter-conviction, and
must then persist undissipated in face of the challenge and in the
last resort find verification in the haphazard instance, under varying
conditions, in actual working. The controversy as to the self-evidence
of perception in which the New Academy effected some
sort of conversion of the younger Stoics, and in which the Sceptics
opposed both, is one of the really vital issues of the decadence.</p>

<p>Another doctrine of the Stoics which has interest in the light of
certain modern developments is their insistence on the place of the
<span class="grk" title="lekton">&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span> in knowledge. Distinct alike from thing and mental
happening, it seems to correspond to &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; as it is used as a
technical phrase now-a-days. This anticipation was apparently
sterile. Along the same lines is their use of the hypothetical form
for the universal judgment, and their treatment of the hypothetical
form as the typical form of inference.</p>

<p>The Stoical categories, too, have an historical significance. They
are apparently offered in place of those of Aristotle, an acquaintance
with whose distinctions they clearly presume. Recognizing a
linguistic side to &ldquo;logical&rdquo; theory with a natural development in
rhetoric, the Stoics endeavour to exorcise considerations of language
from the contrasted side. They offer pure categories arising in
series, each successive one presupposing those that have gone
before. Yet the substance, quality, condition absolute (<span class="grk" title="pôs echon">&#960;&#8182;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;</span>)
and condition relative of Stoicism have no enduring influence outside
the school, though they recur with eclectics like Galen. The
Stoics were too &ldquo;scholastic&rdquo; in their speculations.</p>

<p>In Epicureanism logic is still less in honour. The practical end,
freedom from the bondage of things with the peace it brings, is all
in all, and even scientific inquiry is only in place as a
means to this end. Of the apparatus of method the less
<span class="sidenote">Epicureans.</span>
the better. We are in the presence of a necessary evil.
Yet, in falling back, with a difference, upon the atomism of Democritus,
Epicurus had to face some questions of logic. In the inference
from phenomena to further phenomena positive verification must be
insisted on. In the inference from phenomena to their non-phenomenal
causes, the atoms with their inaccessibility to sense, a different
canon of validity obtains, that of non-contradiction.<a name="fa88b" id="fa88b" href="#ft88b"><span class="sp">88</span></a> He distinguishes
too between the inference to combination of atoms as
universal cause, and inference to special causes beyond the range of
sense. In the latter case alternatives may be acquiesced in.<a name="fa89b" id="fa89b" href="#ft89b"><span class="sp">89</span></a> The
practical aim of science is as well achieved if we set forth possible
causes as in showing the actual cause. This pococurantism might
easily be interpreted as an insight into the limitations of inverse
method as such or as a belief in the plurality of causes in Mill&rsquo;s sense
of the phrase. More probably it reflects the fact that Epicurus was,
according to tradition through Nausiphanes, on the whole dominated
by the influences that produced Pyrrhonism. Democritean physics
without a calculus had necessarily proved sterile of determinate
concrete results, and this was more than enough to ripen the naturalism
of the utilitarian school into scepticism. Some reading between
the lines of Lucretius has led the &ldquo;logic&rdquo; of Epicurus to have an
effect on the modern world, but scarcely because of its deserts.</p>

<p>The school of Pyrrho has exercised a more legitimate influence.
Many of the arguments by which the Sceptics enforced their advocacy
of a suspense of judgment are antiquated in type,
but many also are, within the limits of the individualistic
<span class="sidenote">The Sceptics.</span>
theory of knowledge, quite unanswerable. Hume had
constant recourse to this armoury. The major premise of syllogism,
says the Pyrrhonist, is established inductively from the particular
instances. If there be but one of these uncovered by the generalization,
this cannot be sound. If the crocodile moves its upper, not its
lower, jaw, we may not say that all animals move the lower jaw.
The conclusion then is really used to establish the major premise,
and if we still will infer it therefrom we fall into the circular proof.<a name="fa90b" id="fa90b" href="#ft90b"><span class="sp">90</span></a>
Could Mill say more? But again. The inductive enumeration is
either of all cases or of some only. The former is in an indeterminate
or infinite subject-matter impossible. The latter is invalid.<a name="fa91b" id="fa91b" href="#ft91b"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
Less familiar to modern ears is the contention that proof needs a
standard or criterion, while this standard or criterion in turn needs
proof. Or still more the dialectical device by which the sceptic
claims to escape the riposte that his very argument presumes the
validity of this or that principle, viz. the doctrine of the equipollence
of counter-arguments. Of course the counter-contention is no less
valid! So too when the reflection is made that scepticism is after
all a medicine that purges out itself with the disease, the disciple of
Pyrrho and Aenesidemus bows and says, Precisely! The sceptical
suspension of judgment has its limits, however. The Pyrrhonist will
act upon a basis of probabilities. Nay, he even treats the idea of
cause<a name="fa92b" id="fa92b" href="#ft92b"><span class="sp">92</span></a> as probable enough so long as nothing more than action
upon expectation is in question. He adds, however, that any attempt
to establish it is involved in some sort of dilemma. That, for
instance, cause as the correlate of effect only exists with it, and
accordingly, cause which is come while effect is still to come is inconceivable.<a name="fa93b" id="fa93b" href="#ft93b"><span class="sp">93</span></a>
From the subjectivist point of view, which is manifestly
fundamental through most of this, such arguments suasory
of the Pyrrhonist suspense of judgment (<span class="grk" title="epochê">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#967;&#942;</span>) are indeed hard to
answer. It is natural, then, that the central contribution of the
Sceptics to the knowledge controversy lies in the modes (<span class="grk" title="tropoi">&#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#953;</span>) in
which the relativity of phenomena is made good, that these are
elaborated with extreme care, and that they have a modern ring
and are full of instruction even to-day. Scepticism, it must be
confessed, was at the least well equipped to expose the bankruptcy
of the post-Aristotelian dogmatism.</p>

<p>It was only gradually that the Sceptic&rsquo;s art of fence was developed.
From the time of Pyrrho overlapping Aristotle himself, who seems
to have been well content to use the feints of more than one school
among his predecessors, while showing that none of them could
claim to get past his guard, down through a period in which the
decadent academy under Carneades, otherwise dogmatic in its
negations, supplied new thrusts and parries, to Aenesidemus in the
late Ciceronian age, and again to Sextus Empiricus, there seems to
have been something of plasticity and continuous progress. In this
matter the dogmatic schools offer a marked contrast. In especial
it is an outstanding characteristic of the younger rivals to Aristotelianism
that as they sprang up suddenly into being to contest the
claims of the Aristotelian system in the moment of its triumph, so
they reached maturity very suddenly, and thereafter persisted for
the most part in a stereotyped tradition, modified only when convicted
of indefensible weakness. The 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> saw in its first
half the close of Epicurus&rsquo; activity, and the life-work of Chrysippus,
the refounder of Stoicism, is complete before its close. And subsequent
variations seem to have been of a negligible where not of an
eclectic character. In the case of Epicureanism we can happily
judge of the tyranny of the literal tradition by a comparison of
Lucretius with the recorded doctrine of the master. But the rule
apparently obtains throughout that stereotype and compromise
offer themselves as the exhaustive alternative. This is perhaps
fortunate for the history of doctrine, for it produces the commentator,
your Aspasius or Alexander of Aphrodisias, and the substitute for
the critic, your Cicero, or your Galen with his attempt at comprehension
of the Stoic categories and the like while starting from
Aristotelianism. Cicero in particular is important as showing the
effect or philosophical eclecticism upon Roman cultivation, and as
the often author and always popularizer of the Latin terminology
of philosophy.</p>

<p>The cause of the stereotyping of the systems, apart from political
conditions, seems to have been the barrenness of science. Logic
and theory of knowledge go together, and without living science,
theory of knowledge loses touch with life, and logic becomes a
perfunctory thing. Under such circumstances speculative interest
fritters itself and sooner or later the sceptic has his way. Plato is
full of the faith of mathematical physics. Aristotle is optimistic
of achievement over the whole range of the sciences. But the
divorce of science of nature from mathematics, the failure of biological
inquiry to reach so elementary a conception as that of the
nerves, the absence of chemistry from the circle of the sciences,
disappointed the promise of the dawn and the relative achievement
of the noon-day. There is no development. Physical science
remains dialectical, and a physical experiment is as rare in the age
of Lucretius as in that of Empedocles. The cause of eclecticism is
the unsatisfying character of the creeds of such science, in conjunction
with the familiar law that, in triangular or plusquam-triangular
controversies a common hatred will produce an alliance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page905" id="page905"></a>905</span>
based on compromise. A bastard Platonism through hostility to
Stoicism may become agnostic. Stoicism through hostility to its
sceptical critics may prefer to accept some of the positions of the
dogmatic nihilist.</p>

<p>Of the later schools the last to arise was Neoplatonism. The
mathematical sciences, at least, had not proved disappointing.
For those of the school of Plato who refused the apostasy
of the new academy, there was hope either in the mathematical
<span class="sidenote">Neoplatonism.</span>
side of the Pythagoreo-Platonic tradition, or in
its ritual and theological side. Neoplatonism is philosophy become
theosophy, or it is the sermon on the text that God geometrizes.
It is of significance in the general history of thought as the one great
school that developed after the decadence had set in. In its metaphysic
it showed no failure in dialectical constructiveness. In the
history of logic it is of importance because of its production of a
whole series of commentators on the Aristotelian logic. Not only
the <i>Introduction</i> of Porphyry, which had lasting effects on the
Scholastic tradition, but the commentaries of Themistius, and
Simplicius. It was the acceptance of the Aristotelian logic by Neoplatonism
that determined the Aristotelian complexion of the logic
of the next age. If Alexander is responsible for such doctrines as
that of the <i>intellectus acquisitus</i>, it is to Porphyry, with his characteristically
Platonist preference for the doctrine of universals,
and for classification, that we owe the scholastic preoccupation with
the realist controversy, and with the <i>quinque voces</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
Aristotelian predicables as restated by Porphyry.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center">B. <span class="sc">Scholasticism</span></p>

<p>The living force in the spiritual life of the Roman empire was,
after all, not philosophy, but religion, and specifically Christianity.
With the extension of Christianity to the Gentile world it at
length became necessary for it to orientate itself towards what
was best in Greek culture. There is a Stoic element in the ethic
of the Pauline epistles, but the theological affinity that the
Johannine gospel, with its background of philosophic ideas,
exhibits to Platonic and Neoplatonist teaching caused the
effort at absorption to be directed rather in that direction.
Neoplatonism had accepted the Aristotelian logic with its
sharper definition than anything handed down from Plato, and,
except the logic of the Sceptics, there was no longer any rival
discipline of the like prestige. The logic of the Stoics had been
discredited by the sceptical onset, but in any case there was no
organon of a fitness even comparable to Aristotle&rsquo;s for the task
of drawing out the implications of dogmatic premises. Aristotelian
logic secured the imprimatur of the revived Platonism,
and it was primarily because of this that it passed into the service
of Christian theology. The contact of the Church with Platonism
was on the mystical side. Orthodoxy needed to counter heretical
logic not with mysticism, itself the fruitful mother of heresies,
but with argument. Aristotelianism approved itself as the controversial
instrument, and in due course held the field alone. The
upshot is what is called Scholasticism. Scholasticism is the
Aristotelianism of medieval orthodoxy as taught in the
&ldquo;schools&rdquo; or universities of Western Europe. It takes form as a
body of doctrine drawing its premises from authority, sometimes
in secular matters from that of Aristotle, but normally from that
of the documents and traditions of systematic theology, while
its method it draws from Aristotle, as known in the Latin
versions,<a name="fa94b" id="fa94b" href="#ft94b"><span class="sp">94</span></a> mainly by Boethius, of some few treatises of the
<i>Organon</i> together with the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyry. It dominates
the centres of intellectual life in the West because, despite its
claim to finality in its principles or premises, and to universality
for its method, it represents the only culture of a philosophic
kind available to the adolescent peoples of the Western nations
just becoming conscious of their ignorance. Christianity was
the one organizing principle that pulsed with spiritual life.
The vocation of the student could find fulfilment only in the
religious orders. Scholasticism embodied what the Christian
community had saved from the wreckage of Greek dialectic. Yet
with all its effective manipulation of the formal technique of its
translated and mutilated Aristotle, Scholasticism would have
gone under long before it did through the weakness intrinsic to
its divorce of the form and the matter of knowledge, but for two
reasons. The first is the filtering through of some science and
some new Aristotelian learning from the Arabs. The second
is the spread of Greek scholarship and Greek manuscripts westward,
which was consequent on the Latin occupation of Constantinople
in 1204. It was respited by the opportunity which
was afforded it of fresh draughts from the Aristotle of a less
partial and purer tradition, and we have, accordingly, a golden
age of revived Scholasticism beginning in the 13th century,
admitting now within itself more differences than before. It is to
the schoolmen of the two centuries preceding the Turkish
capture of Constantinople that the controversial refinements
usually associated with the name of Scholasticism are attributable.
The <i>Analytics</i> of Aristotle now entered quite definitely
into the logical thought of Scholasticism and we have the contrast
of a <i>logica vetus</i> and <i>logica nova</i>. That other matters, the <i>parva
logicalia</i> and Mnemonics adapted from Psellus and possibly of
Stoic origin, entered too did not outweigh this advantage.
Confrontation with the historical Aristotle may have brought
but little comfort to the orthodox system, but it was a stimulus
to dialectical activity within the schools. It provoked the
distinction of what was true <i>secundum fidem</i> and what was true
<i>secundum rationem</i> among even sincere champions of orthodoxy,
and their opponents accepted with a smile so admirable a mask
for that thinking for themselves to which the revival of hope
of progress had spurred them. The pioneers of the Renaissance
owe something of their strength to their training in the developments
which the system that they overthrew underwent during
this period. The respite, however, was short. The flight of
Byzantine scholarship westward in the 15th century revealed,
and finally, that the philosophic content of the Scholastic teaching
was as alien from Aristotle as from the spirit of the contemporary
revolt of science, with its cry for a new medicine, a new nautical
astronomy and the like. The doom of the Scholastic Aristotle
was nevertheless not the rehabilitation of the Greek Aristotle.
Between him and the tide of feeling at the Renaissance lay
the whole achievement of Arab science. That impatience of
authority to which we owe the Renaissance, the Reformation
and the birth of Nationalism, is not stilled by the downfall of
Aristotle as the <i>nomen appellativum</i> of the schools. The appeal
is to experience, somewhat vaguely defined, as against all
authority, to the book of nature and no other. At last the world
undertakes to enlarge the circle of its ideas.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">C. The Renaissance</span></p>

<p>Accordingly what is in one sense the revival of classical
learning is in another a recourse to what inspired that learning,
and so is a new beginning. There is no place for a reformed
Aristotelian logic, though the genius of Zabarella was there to
attempt it. Nor for revivals of the competing systems, though
all have their advocates. Scientific discovery was in the air.
The tradition of the old world was too heavily weighted with
the Ptolemaic astronomy and the like to be regarded as other than
a bar to progress. But from the new point of view its method was
inadequate too, its contentment with an induction that merely
leaves an opponent silent, when experiment and the application
of a calculus were within the possibilities. The transformation
of logic lay with the man of science, hindered though he might
be by the enthusiasm of some of the philosophers of nature.
Henceforth the Aristotelian logic, the genuine no less than the
traditional, was to lie on the other side of the Copernican change.</p>

<p>The demand is for a new organon, a scientific method which
shall face the facts of experience and justify itself by its achievement
in the reduction of them to control. It is a notable feature
of the new movement, that except verbally, in a certain licence
of nominalist expression, due to the swing of the pendulum away
from the realist doctrine of universals, there is little that we can
characterize as Empiricism. Facts are opposed to abstract
universals. Yes. Particulars to controlling formulae. No.
Experience is appealed to as fruitful where the formal employment
of syllogism is barren. But it is not mere induction, with its
&ldquo;unanalysed concretes taken as ultimate&rdquo; that is set up as the
substitute for deduction. Rather a scientific process, which as
experiential may be called inductive, but which is to other
regards deductive as syllogism, is set up in <span class="correction" title="amended from constrast">contrast</span> to syllogism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page906" id="page906"></a>906</span>
and enumeration alike. This is to be seen in Zabarella,<a name="fa95b" id="fa95b" href="#ft95b"><span class="sp">95</span></a> in
Galilei,<a name="fa96b" id="fa96b" href="#ft96b"><span class="sp">96</span></a> and in Bacon. The reformed Aristotelian logic of the
first-named with its <i>inductio demonstrativa</i>, the mathematico-physical
analysis followed by synthesis of the second, the <i>exclusiva</i>,
or method of exclusions of the last, agree at least in this, that the
method of science is one and indivisible, while containing both
an inductive and a deductive moment. That what, <i>e.g.</i>, Bacon
says of his method may run counter to this is an accident of the
tradition of the quarrel with realism. So, too, with the scholastic
universals. Aristotle&rsquo;s forms had been correlated, though
inadequately, with the idea of function. Divorced from this they
are fairly stigmatized as mental figments or branded as ghostly
entities that can but block the path. But consider Bacon&rsquo;s own
doctrine of forms. Or watch the mathematical physicist with his
formulae. The faith of science looks outward as in the dawn of
Greek philosophy, and subjectivism such as Hume&rsquo;s has as yet
no hold. Bacon summing up the movement so far as he understood
it, in a rather belated way, has no theory of knowledge
beyond the metaphor of the mirror held up to nature. Yet he
offers an ambitious logic of science, and the case is typical.</p>

<p>The science of the Renaissance differs from that of the false
dawn in Greek times in the fact of fruitfulness. It had the
achievement of the old world in the field of mathematics
upon which to build. It was in reaction against
<span class="sidenote">Galilei.</span>
a dialectic and not immediately to be again entrapped. In
scientific method, then, it could but advance, provided physics
and mathematics did not again fail of accord. Kepler and
Galilei secured it against that disaster. The <i>ubi materia ibi
geometria</i> of the one is the battle-cry of the mathematico-physical
advance. The scientific instrument of the other, with its moments
of analysis and construction, <i>metodo risolutivo</i> and <i>metodo
compositivo</i>, engineers the road for the advance. The new
method of physics is verifiable by its fruitfulness, and so free of
any immediate danger from dialectic. Its germinal thought
may not have been new, but, if not new, it had at least needed
rediscovery from the beginning. For it was to be at once certain
and experiential. A mathematico-physical calculus that would
work was in question. The epistemological problem as such was
out of the purview. The relation of physical laws to the mind
that thought them was for the time a negligible constant.
When Descartes, having faithfully and successfully followed the
mathematico-physical inquiry of his more strictly scientific
predecessors, found himself compelled to raise the question how
it was possible for him to know what in truth he seemed to know
so certainly, the problem entered on a new phase. The scientific
movement had happily been content for the time with a half
which, then and there at least, was more than the whole.</p>

<p>Bacon was no mathematician, and so was out of touch with the
main army of progress. By temperament he was rather with
the Humanists. He was content to voice the cry for
the overthrow of the dominant system as such, and
<span class="sidenote">Bacon.</span>
to call for a new beginning, with no realist presuppositions.
He is with the nominalists of the later Scholasticism and the
naturalists of the early Renaissance. He echoes the cry for
recourse to nature, for induction, for experiment. He calls for
a logic of discovery. But at first sight there is little sign of any
greater contribution to the reconstruction than is to be found
in Ramus or many another dead thinker. The syllogism is
ineffective, belonging to argumentation, and constraining assent
where what we want is control of things. It is a mechanical
combination of propositions as these of terms which are counters
to express concepts often ill-defined. The flight from a cursory
survey of facts to wide so-called principles must give way to a
gradual progress upward from propositions of minimum to those
of medium generality, and in these consists the fruitfulness of
science. Yet the induction of the Aristotelians, the dialectical
induction of the <i>Topics</i>, content with imperfect enumeration
and with showing the burden of disproof upon the critic, is
puerile, and at the mercy of a single instance to the contrary.
In all this there is but little promise for a new organon. It is
neither novel nor instrumental. On a sudden Bacon&rsquo;s conception
of a new method begins to unfold itself. It is inductive only
in the sense that it is identical in purpose with the ascent from
particulars. It were better called exclusiva or elimination of
the alternative, which Bacon proposes to achieve, and thereby
guarantee his conclusion against the possibility of instance to
the contrary.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Bacon&rsquo;s method begins with a digest into three tables of the facts
relevant to any inquiry. The first contains cases of the occurrence
of the quality under investigation, colour, <i>e.g.</i>, or heat, in
varying combinations. The second notes its absence in
<span class="sidenote">His three Methods.</span>
combinations so allied to certain of these that its presence
might fairly have been looked for. The third registers its
quantitative variation according to quantitative changes in its
concomitants. The method now proceeds on the basis of the first
table to set forth the possible suggestions as to a general explanatory
formula for the quality in question. In virtue of the remaining
tables it rejects any suggestion qualitatively or quantitatively
inadequate. If one suggestion, and one alone, survives the process
of attempted rejection it is the explanatory formula required. If
none, we must begin afresh. If more than one, recourse is to be
had to certain devices of method, in the enumeration of which the
methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variations<a name="fa97b" id="fa97b" href="#ft97b"><span class="sp">97</span></a>
find a place, beside the crucial experiment, the glaring instance and
the like. An appeal, however, to such devices, though a permissible
&ldquo;first vintage&rdquo; is relatively an imperfection of method, and a proof
that the tables need revision. The positive procedure by hypothesis
and verification is rejected by Bacon, who thinks of hypothesis as
the will o&rsquo; the wisp of science, and prefers the cumbrous machinery
of negative reasoning.</p>

<p>Historically he appears to have been under the dominance of the
Platonic metaphor of an alphabet of nature, with a consequent
belief in the relatively small number of ultimate principles to be
determined, and of Plato&rsquo;s conception of Division, cleared of its
dialectical associations and used experientially in application to his
own molecular physics. True it is that the rejection of all the cospecies
is a long process, but what if therein their simultaneous or
subsequent determination is helped forward? They, too, must fall
to be determined sometime, and the ideal of science is fully to
determine all the species of the genus. This will need co-operative
effort as described in the account of Solomon&rsquo;s House in the <i>New
Atlantis</i>.<a name="fa98b" id="fa98b" href="#ft98b"><span class="sp">98</span></a> But once introduce the conception of division of labour
as between the collector of data on the one hand and the expert of
method, the interpreter of nature at headquarters, on the other,
and Bacon&rsquo;s attitude to hypothesis and to negative reasoning is at
least in part explained. The hypothesis of the collector, the man
who keeps a rain-gauge, or the missionary among savages, is to be
discounted from as a source of error. The expert on the other hand
may be supposed, in the case of facts over which he has not himself
brooded in the course of their acquisition, to approach them without
any presumption this way or that. He will, too, have no interest
in the isolation of any one of several co-ordinate inquiries. That
Bacon underestimates the importance of selective and of provisional
explanatory hypotheses even in such fields as that of chemistry,
and that technically he is open to some criticism from the point of
view that negative judgment is derivate as necessarily resting on
positive presuppositions, may be true enough. It seems, however,
no less true that the greatness of his conception of organized common
effort in science has but rarely met with due appreciation.</p>

<p>In his doctrine of <i>forms</i>, too, the &ldquo;universals&rdquo; of his logic, Bacon
must at least be held to have been on a path which led forward and
not back. His forms are principles whose function falls
entirely within knowledge. They are formulae for the
<span class="sidenote">Forms.</span>
control of the activities and the production of the qualities of bodies.
Forms are qualities and activities expressed in terms of the ultimates
of nature, <i>i.e.</i> normally in terms of collocations of matter or modes
of motion. (The human soul is still an exception.) Form is bound
up with the molecular structure and change of structure of a body,
one of whose qualities or activities it expresses in wider relations.
A mode of motion, for instance, of a certain definite kind, is the
form of heat. It is the recipe for, and at the same time is, heat,
much as H<span class="su">2</span>O is the formula for and is water. Had Bacon analysed
bodies into their elements, instead of their qualities and ways of
behaviour, he would have been the logician of the chemical formula.
Here, too, he has scarcely received his meed of appreciation.</p>

<p>His influence on his successors has rather lain in the general stimulus
of his enthusiasm for experience, or in the success with which he
represents the cause of nominalism and in certain special devices of
method handed down till, through Hume or Herschel, they affected
the thought of Mill. For the rest he was too Aristotelian, if we take
the word broadly enough, or, as the result of his Cambridge studies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page907" id="page907"></a>907</span>
too Ramist,<a name="fa99b" id="fa99b" href="#ft99b"><span class="sp">99</span></a> when the interest in scholastic issues was fading, to
bring his original ideas to a successful market.</p>

<p>Bacon&rsquo;s Logic, then, like Galilei&rsquo;s, intended as a contribution to
scientific method, a systematization of discovery by which, given
the fact of knowledge, new items of knowledge may be acquired,
failed to convince contemporaries and successors alike of its efficiency
as an instrument. It was an ideal that failed to embody itself
and justify itself by its fruits. It was otherwise with the mathematical
instrument of Galilei.</p>
</div>

<p>Descartes stands in the following of Galilei. It is concurrently
with signal success in the work of a pioneer in the mathematical
advance that he comes to reflect on method, generalizes
the method of mathematics to embrace knowledge as
<span class="sidenote">Descartes.</span>
a whole, and raises the ultimate issues of its presuppositions.
In the mathematics we determine complex problems by a construction
link by link from axioms and simple data clearly and
distinctly conceived. Three moments are involved. The first
is an <i>induction</i>, <i>i.e.</i> an exhaustive enumeration of the simple
elements in the complex phenomenon under investigation.
This resolution or analysis into simple, because clear and distinct,
elements may be brought to a standstill again and again by
obscurity and indistinctness, but patient and repeated revision
of all that is included in the problem should bring the analytic
process to fruition. It is impatience, a perversity of will, that is
the cause of error. Upon the analysis there results <i>intuition</i>
of the simple data. With Descartes intuition does not connote
givenness, but its objects are evident at a glance when induction
has brought them to light. Lastly we have <i>deduction</i> the determination
of the most complex phenomena by a continuous
synthesis or combination of the simple elements. Synthesis
is demonstrative and complete. It is in virtue of this view of
derived or mediate knowledge that Descartes speaks of the
(subsumptive) syllogism as &ldquo;of avail rather in the communication
of what we already know.&rdquo; Syllogism is not the synthesis
which together with analysis goes to constitute the new instrument
of science. The celebrated <i>Regulae</i> of Descartes are precepts
directed to the achievement of the new methodological
ideal in any and every subject matter, however reluctant.</p>

<p>It is the paradox involved in the function of intuition, the
acceptance of the psychological characters of clearness and distinctness
as warranty of a truth presumed to be trans-subjective,
that leads to Descartes&rsquo;s distinctive contribution to the theory
of knowledge. In order to lay bare the ground of certainty he
raises the universal doubt, and, although, following Augustine,<a name="fa100b" id="fa100b" href="#ft100b"><span class="sp">100</span></a>
he finds its limit in the thought of the doubter, this of itself is
not enough. <i>Cogito, ergo sum.</i> <i>That</i> I think may be admitted.
<i>What</i> I think may still need validation. Descartes&rsquo;s guarantee
of the validity of my clear and distinct perceptions is the veracity
of God.<a name="fa101b" id="fa101b" href="#ft101b"><span class="sp">101</span></a> Does the existence of God in turn call for proof? An
effect cannot contain more than its cause, nor the idea of a
perfect Being find adequate source save in the actuality of such
a Being. Thus the intuition of the casual axiom is used to prove
the existence of that which alone gives validity to intuitions.
Though the logical method of Descartes has a great and enduring
influence, it is the dualism and the need of God to bridge it, the
doctrine of &ldquo;innate&rdquo; ideas, <i>i.e.</i> of ideas not due to external
causes nor to volition but only to our capacity to think, our
disposition to develop them, and finally the ontological proof,
that affect the thought of the next age most deeply. That
essence in the supreme case involves existence is a thought
which comes to Spinoza more easily, together with the tradition
of the <i>ordo geometricus</i>.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">D. <span class="sc">Modern Logic</span></p>

<p class="center">i. <i>The Logic of Empiricism</i></p>

<p>The path followed by English thought was a different one.
Hobbes developed the nominalism which had been the hallmark
of revolt against scholastic orthodoxy, and, when he brings
this into relation with the analysis and synthesis of scientific
method, it is at the expense of the latter.<a name="fa102b" id="fa102b" href="#ft102b"><span class="sp">102</span></a> Locke, when Cartesianism
had raised the problem of the contents of consciousness,
and the spirit of Baconian positivism could not accept of
anything that bore the ill-omened name of innate ideas, elaborated
a theory of knowledge which is psychological in the sense that
its problem is how the simple data with which the individual is
in contact in sensation are worked up into a system. Though he
makes his bow to mathematical method, he, even more than
Hobbes, misses its constructive character. The clue of mathematical
certainty is discarded in substance in the English form
of &ldquo;the new way of ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Hobbes logic is a calculus of marks and signs in the
form of names. Naming is what distinguishes man from the
brutes. It enables him to fix fleeting memories
and to communicate with his fellows. He alone is
<span class="sidenote">Hobbes.</span>
capable of truth in the due conjunction or disjunction of names
in propositions. Syllogism is simply summation of propositions,
its function being communication merely. Analysis is the sole
way of invention or discovery. There is more, however, in
Hobbes, than the paradox of nominalism. Spinoza could draw
upon him for the notion of genetic definition.<a name="fa103b" id="fa103b" href="#ft103b"><span class="sp">103</span></a> Leibnitz probably
owes to him the thought of a calculus of symbols, and the conception
of demonstration as essentially a chain of definitions.<a name="fa104b" id="fa104b" href="#ft104b"><span class="sp">104</span></a> His
psychological account of syllogism<a name="fa105b" id="fa105b" href="#ft105b"><span class="sp">105</span></a> is taken over by Locke.
Hume derived from him the explanatory formula of the association
of ideas,<a name="fa106b" id="fa106b" href="#ft106b"><span class="sp">106</span></a> which is, however, still with Hobbes a fact to be
accounted for, not a theory to account for facts, being grounded
physically in &ldquo;coherence of the matter moved.&rdquo; Finally Mill
took from him his definition of cause as sum of conditions,<a name="fa107b" id="fa107b" href="#ft107b"><span class="sp">107</span></a>
which played no small part in the applied logic of the 19th
century.</p>

<p>Locke is of more importance, if not for his logical doctrine,
at least for the theory of knowledge from which it flows. With
Locke the mind is comparable to white paper on which
the world of things records itself in ideas of sensation.
<span class="sidenote">Locke.</span>
Simple ideas of sensation are the only points of contact we have
with things. They are the atomic elements which &ldquo;the workmanship
of the understanding&rdquo; can thereafter do no more than
systematically compound and the like. It is Locke&rsquo;s initial
attribution of the primary rôle in mental process to the simple
ideas of sensation that precludes him from the development of
the conception of another sort of ideas, or mental contents that
he notes, which are produced by reflection on &ldquo;the operations of
our own mind within us.&rdquo; It is in the latter group that we have
the explanation of all that marks Locke as a forerunner of the
critical philosophy. It contains in germ a doctrine of categories
discovered but not generated in the psychological processes of
the individual. Locke, however, fails to &ldquo;deduce&rdquo; his categories.
He has read Plato&rsquo;s <i>Theaetetus</i> in the light of Baconian
and individualist preconceptions. Reflection remains a sort of
&ldquo;internal sense,&rdquo; whose ideas are of later origin than those of the
external sense. His successors emphasize the sensationist
elements, not the workmanship of the mind. When Berkeley
has eliminated the literal materialism of Locke&rsquo;s metaphors of
sense-perception, Hume finds no difficulty in accepting the
sensations as present virtually in their own right, any nonsensible
ground being altogether unknown. From a point of
view purely subjectivist he is prepared to explain all that is to be
left standing of what Locke ascribes to the workmanship of the
mind by the principle of association or customary conjunction of
ideas, which Locke had added a chapter to a later edition of his
<i>Essay</i> explicitly to reject as an explanatory formula. Condillac
goes a step farther, and sees no necessity for the superstructure
at all, with its need of explanation valid or invalid. Drawing
upon Gassendi for his psychological atomism and upon Hobbes
for a thoroughgoing nominalism, he reproduces, as the logical
conclusion from Locke&rsquo;s premises, the position of Antisthenes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page908" id="page908"></a>908</span>
The last word is that &ldquo;une science bien traitée n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;une
langue bien faite.&rdquo;<a name="fa108b" id="fa108b" href="#ft108b"><span class="sp">108</span></a></p>

<p>Locke&rsquo;s logic comprises, amid much else, a theory of general
terms<a name="fa109b" id="fa109b" href="#ft109b"><span class="sp">109</span></a> and of definition, a view of syllogism<a name="fa110b" id="fa110b" href="#ft110b"><span class="sp">110</span></a> and a declaration
as to the possibility of inference from particular to particular,<a name="fa111b" id="fa111b" href="#ft111b"><span class="sp">111</span></a>
a distinction between propositions which are certain but trifling,
and those which add to our knowledge though uncertain, and a
doctrine of mathematical certainty.<a name="fa112b" id="fa112b" href="#ft112b"><span class="sp">112</span></a> As to the first, &ldquo;words
become general by being made the signs of general ideas, and
ideas become general by separating from them&rdquo; all &ldquo;that may
determine them to this or that particular existence. By this
way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more
individuals than one.&rdquo; This doctrine has found no acceptance.
Not from the point of view for which idea means image.
Berkeley, though at length the <i>notions</i> of spirits, acts and
relations<a name="fa113b" id="fa113b" href="#ft113b"><span class="sp">113</span></a> give him pause, prefers the formula which Hume
expresses in the phrase that &ldquo;some ideas are particular in their
nature but general in their representation,&rdquo;<a name="fa114b" id="fa114b" href="#ft114b"><span class="sp">114</span></a> and the after-history
of &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; is a discussion of the conditions
under which one idea &ldquo;stands for&rdquo; a group. Not from those
for whom general ideas mean schematic concepts, not imageable.
The critic from this side has little difficulty in showing that
abstraction of the kind alleged still leave the residuum particular
<i>this</i> redness, <i>e.g.</i> not <i>redness</i>. It is, however, of the sorts constituted
by the representation which his abstraction makes
possible that definition is given, either by enumeration of the
simple ideas combined in the significance of the sortal name, or
&ldquo;to save the labour of enumerating,&rdquo; and &ldquo;for quickness and
despatch sake,&rdquo; by giving the next wider general name and the
proximate difference. We define essences of course in a sense,
but the essences of which men talk are abstractions, &ldquo;creatures
of the understanding.&rdquo; Man determines the sorts or nominal
essences, nature the similitudes. The fundamentally enumerative
character of the process is clearly not cancelled by the
recognition that it is possible to abbreviate it by means of
technique. So long as the relation of the nominal to the real
essence has no other background than Locke&rsquo;s doctrine of
perception, the conclusion that what Kant afterwards calls
analytical judgments a priori and synthetic judgments a posteriori
exhaust the field follows inevitably, with its corollary, which
Locke himself has the courage to draw, that the natural sciences
are in strictness impossible. Mathematical knowledge is not
involved in the same condemnation, solely because of the
&ldquo;archetypal&rdquo; character, which, not without indebtedness to
Cumberland, Locke attributes to its ideas. The reality of
mathematics, equally with that of the ideals of morals drawn
from within, does not extend to the &ldquo;ectypes&rdquo; of the outer world.
The view of reasoning which Locke enunciates coheres with
these views. Reasoning from particular to particular, <i>i.e.</i>
without the necessity of a general premise, must be possible, and
the possibility finds warranty in a consideration of the psychological
order of the terms in syllogism. As to syllogism specifically,
Locke in a passage,<a name="fa115b" id="fa115b" href="#ft115b"><span class="sp">115</span></a> which has an obviously Cartesian
ring, lays down four stages or degrees of reasoning, and points
out that syllogism serves us in but one of these, and that not the
all-important one of finding the intermediate ideas. He is
prepared readily to &ldquo;own that all right reasoning may be reduced
to Aristotle&rsquo;s forms of syllogism,&rdquo; yet holds that &ldquo;a man knows
first, and then he is able to prove syllogistically.&rdquo; The distance
from Locke to Stuart Mill along this line of thought is obviously
but small.</p>

<p>Apart from the adoption by Hume of the association of ideas
as the explanatory formula of the school&mdash;it had been allowed by
Malebranche within the framework of his mysticism
and employed by Berkeley in his theory of vision&mdash;there
<span class="sidenote">Hume.</span>
are few fresh notes struck in the logic of sensationalism.
The most notable of these are Berkeley&rsquo;s treatment of &ldquo;abstract&rdquo;
ideas and Hume&rsquo;s change of front as to mathematical certainty.
What, however, Hume describes as &ldquo;all the <i>logic</i> I think proper
to employ in my reasoning,&rdquo; viz. his &ldquo;rules by which to judge
cause and effects,&rdquo;<a name="fa116b" id="fa116b" href="#ft116b"><span class="sp">116</span></a> had, perhaps, farther-reaching historical
effects than either. In these the single method of Bacon is
already split up into separate modes. We have Mill&rsquo;s inductive
methods in the germ, though with an emphasis quite older than
Mill&rsquo;s. Bacon&rsquo;s <i>form</i> has already in transmission through Hobbes
been transmuted into <i>cause</i> as antecedent in the time series. It
may, perhaps, be accounted to Hume for righteousness that he
declares&mdash;whether consistently or not is another matter&mdash;that
&ldquo;the same effect never arises but from the same cause,&rdquo; and
that he still follows Bacon in the conception of <i>absentia in
proximo</i>. It is &ldquo;when in any instance we find our expectation
disappointed&rdquo; that the effect of one of &ldquo;two resembling objects&rdquo;
will be like that of the other that Hume proposes to apply his
method of difference.</p>

<p>No scientific discipline, however, with the doubtful exception
of descriptive psychology, stands to gain anything from a temper
like that of Hume. The whittling away of its formal or organizing
rubrics, as <i>e.g.</i>, sameness into likeness, is disconcerting to science
wherever the significance of the process is realized. It was because
the aftermath of Newtonian science was so rich that the scientific
faith of naturalism was able to retain a place besides its epistemological
creed that a logician of the school could arise whose spirit
was in some sort Baconian, but who, unlike Bacon, had entered
the modern world, and faced the problems stated for it by Hume
and by Newton.</p>

<p>Stuart Mill&rsquo;s <i>System of Logic</i> marked a fresh stage in the history
of empiricism, for the reason that it made the effort to hold an
even balance between the two moments in the thought
of the school. Agreement in the use of a common
<span class="sidenote">J. S. Mill.</span>
watchword had masked as it seems a real divergence of meaning
and purpose. The apostles of inductive method had preached
recourse to experience, but had meant thereby nature as a
constituted order. They had devised canons for the investigation
of the concrete problems of this, but had either ignored altogether
the need to give an account of the mirroring mind, or, in the
alternative had been, with some naïveté, content to assume that
their nominalist friends, consistently their allies in the long
struggle with traditionalism, had adequately supplied or could
adequately supply the need. The exponents of psychological
atomism, on the other hand, with the association of ideas for
their one principle of agglutination had come to mean by
experience the mental phantasmagoria of the individual. They
had undermined the foundations of scientific certainty, and so
far as the fecundity of contemporary science did not give them
pause, were ready, notwithstanding the difference of their
starting-point, to acquiesce in the formula as well as the temper
of Pyrrhonism. They could concede the triumphant achievement
of science only with the proviso that it must be assumed to fall
within the framework of their nominalism. Mill aspired after a
doctrine of method such as should satisfy the needs of the natural
sciences, notably experimental physics and chemistry as understood
in the first half of the 19th century and, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
of the moral sciences naturalistically construed. In uniting with
this the Associationism which he inherited, through his father,
from Hume, he revealed at once the strength and weakness of
the dual conception of naturalism. His rare thoroughness and
rarer candour made it at once unnecessary and impossible that
the work should be done again.</p>

<p>If judged by what he denies, viz. the formal logic of Hamilton
and Mansel, whose Aristotelian and scholastic learning did but
accentuate their traditionalism, and whose acquiescence in
consistency constituted in Mill&rsquo;s view a discouragement of
research, such as men now incline to attribute at the least
equally to Hume&rsquo;s idealism, Mill is only negatively justified.
If judged by his positive contribution to the theory of method
he may claim to find a more than negative justification for his
teaching in its success. In the field covered by scholastic logic
Mill is frankly associationist. He aims at describing what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page909" id="page909"></a>909</span>
finds given, without reference to insensible implications of
doubtful validity and value. The upshot is a psychological
account of what from one aspect is evidence, from the other,
belief. So he explains &ldquo;concepts or general notions&rdquo;<a name="fa117b" id="fa117b" href="#ft117b"><span class="sp">117</span></a> by an
abstraction which he represents as a sort of alt-relief operated
by attention and fixed by naming, association with the name
giving to a set of attributes a unity they otherwise lack. This
is manifestly, when all is said, a particular psychological event,
a collective fact of the associative consciousness. It can exercise
no organizing or controlling function in knowledge. So again
in determining the &ldquo;import&rdquo; of propositions, it is no accident
that in all save existential propositions it is to the familiar rubrics
of associationism&mdash;co-existence, sequence, causation and resemblance&mdash;that
he refers for classification, while his general formula
as to the conjunctions of connotations is associationist through
and through. It follows consistently enough that inference is
from particular to particular. Mill holds even the ideas of
mathematics to be hypothetical, and in theory knows nothing of
a non-enumerative or non-associative universal. A premise that
has the utmost universality consistent with this view can clearly
be of no service for the establishment of a proposition that has
gone to the making of it. Nor again of one that has not. Its
use, then, can only be as a memorandum. It is a shorthand
formula of registration. Mill&rsquo;s view of ratiocinative process
clearly stands and falls with the presumed impossibility of
establishing the necessity for universals of another type than his,
for what may be called principles of construction. His critics
incline to press the point that association itself is only intelligible
so far as it is seen to depend on universals of the kind that he
denies.</p>

<p>In Mill&rsquo;s inductive logic, the nominalistic convention has,
through his tendency to think in relatively watertight compartments,<a name="fa118b" id="fa118b" href="#ft118b"><span class="sp">118</span></a>
faded somewhat into the background. Normally
he thinks of what he calls phenomena no longer as psychological
groupings of sensations, as &ldquo;states of mind,&rdquo; but as things and
events in a physical world howsoever constituted and apprehended.
His free use of relating concepts, that of sameness,
for instance, bears no impress of his theory of the general notion,
and it is possible to put out of sight the fact that, taken in conjunction
with his nominalism, it raises the whole issue of the
possibility of the equivocal generation of formative principles
from the given contents of the individual consciousness, in any
manipulation of which they are already implied. Equally, too,
the deductive character, apparently in intention as well as in
actual fact, of Mill&rsquo;s experimental methods fails to recall the
point of theory that the process is essentially one from particular
to particular. The nerve of proof in the processes by which he
establishes causal conjunctions of unlimited application is
naturally thought to lie in the special canons of the several
processes and the axioms of universal and uniform causation
which form their background. The conclusions seem not merely
to fall within, but to depend on these organic and controlling
formulae. They follow not merely according to them but from
them. The reference to the rule is not one which may be made
and normally is made as a safeguard, but one which must be
made, if thought is engaged in a forward and constructive movement
at all. Yet Mill&rsquo;s view of the function of &ldquo;universal&rdquo;
propositions had been historically suggested by a theory&mdash;Dugald
Stewart&rsquo;s&mdash;of the use of axioms!<a name="fa119b" id="fa119b" href="#ft119b"><span class="sp">119</span></a> Once more, it would be
possible to forget that Mill&rsquo;s ultimate laws or axioms are not in
his view intuitions, nor forms constitutive of the rational order,
nor postulates of all rational construction, were it not that he has
made the endeavour to establish them on associationist lines.
It is because of the failure of this endeavour to bring the technique
of induction within the setting of his Humian psychology of
belief that the separation of his contribution to the applied logic
of science from his sensationism became necessary, as it happily
was easy. Mill&rsquo;s device rested special inductions of causation
upon the laws that every event has a cause, and every cause has
always the same effect. It rested these in turn upon a general
induction enumerative in character of enormous and practically
infinite range and always uncontradicted. Though obviously
not exhaustive, the unique extent of this induction was held to
render it competent to give practical certainty or psychological
necessity. A vicious circle is obviously involved. It is true, of
course, that ultimate laws need discovery, that they are discovered
in some sense in the medium of the psychological
mechanism, and that they are nevertheless the grounds of all
specific inferences. But that truth is not what Mill expounds,
nor is it capable of development within the limits imposed by
the associationist formula.</p>

<p>It is deservedly, nevertheless, that Mill&rsquo;s applied logic has
retained its pride of place amid what has been handed on, if in
modified shape, by writers, <i>e.g.</i>, Sigwart, and Professor Bosanquet,
whose theory of knowledge is quite alien from his. He prescribed
regulative or limiting formulae for research as it was actually
conducted in his world. His grasp of the procedure by which the
man of science manipulated his particular concrete problems was
admirable. In especial he showed clear understanding of the
functions of hypothesis and verification in the investigations of
the solitary worker, with his facts still in course of accumulation
and needing to be lighted up by the scientific imagination.
He was therefore enabled to formulate the method of what
Bacon had tended to despise as merely the &ldquo;first vintage.&rdquo;
Bacon spent his strength upon a dream of organization for all
future discovery. Mill was content to codify. The difference
between Bacon and Mill lies chiefly in this, and it is because of
this difference that Mill&rsquo;s contribution, spite of its debt to the
Baconian tradition, remains both characteristic and valuable.
It is of course possible to criticise even the experimental canons
with some severity. The caveats, however, which are relevant
within the circle of ideas within which Mill&rsquo;s lesson can be learned
and improved on,<a name="fa120b" id="fa120b" href="#ft120b"><span class="sp">120</span></a> seem to admit of being satisfied by relatively
slight modifications in detail, or by explanations often supplied
or easily to be supplied from points brought out amid the wealth
of illustration with which Mill accompanied his formal or systematic
exposition of method. The critic has the right of it when
he points out, for example, that the practical difficulty in the
Method of Agreement is not due to plurality of causes, as Mill
states, but rather to intermixture of effects, while, if the canon
could be satisfied exactly, the result would not be rendered
uncertain in the manner or to the extent which he supposes.
Again the formula of the Joint-Method, which contemplates the
enumeration of cases &ldquo;which have nothing in common but the
absence of one circumstance,&rdquo; is ridiculously unsound as it
stands. Or, on rather a different line of criticism, the use of
corresponding letters in the two series of antecedents and
consequents raises, it is said, a false presumption of correlation.
Nay, even the use of letters at all suggests that the sort of analysis
that actually breaks up its subject-matter is universally or all
but universally applicable in nature, and this is not the case.
Finally, the conditions of the methods are either realized or not.
If they are realized, the work of the scientist falls entirely within
the field of the processes preliminary to the satisfaction of the
canon. The latter becomes a mere memorandum or formula of
registration. So is it possible &ldquo;to have the enginer hoist with
his own petar.&rdquo; But the conditions are not realized, and in an
experiential subject-matter are not realizable. Not one circumstance
only in common but &ldquo;apparently one relevant circumstance
only in common&rdquo; is what we are able to assert. If we add
the qualification of relevance we destroy the cogency of the
method. If we fail to add it, we destroy the applicability.</p>

<p>The objections turn on two main issues. One is the exaggeration
of the possibilities of resolution into separate elements that
is due to the acceptance of the postulate of an alphabet of
nature. This so soon as noted can be allowed for. It is to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page910" id="page910"></a>910</span>
combination of this doctrine with a tendency to think chiefly of
experiment, of the controlled addition or subtraction of these
elements one at a time, that we owe the theoretically premature
linking of <i>a</i> as effect to <i>A</i> as cause. This too can be met by a
modification of form. The other issue is perhaps of more significance.
It is the oscillation which Mill manifests between the
conception of his formula as it is actually applicable to concrete
problems in practice, and the conception of it as an expression of
a theoretical limit to practical procedure. Mill seems most often
to think of the former, while tending to formulate in terms of the
latter. At any rate, if relevance <i>in proximo</i> is interpolated in the
peccant clause of the canon of the Joint-Method, the practical
utility of the method is rehabilitated. So too, if the canon
of the Method of Agreement is never more than approximately
satisfied, intermixture of effects will in practice mean
that we at least often do not know the cause or antecedent
equivalent of a given effect, without the possibility of an
alternative. Finally, it is on the whole in keeping with Mill&rsquo;s
presuppositions to admit even in the case of the method of
difference that in practice it is approximative and instructive,
while the theoretical formula, to which it aims at approaching
asymptotically as limit, if exact, is in some sense sterile. Mill
may well have himself conceived his methods as practically
fruitful and normally convincing with the limiting formula in
each case more cogent in form but therewith merely the skeleton
of the process that but now pulsed with life.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show why the advance beyond the
letter of Mill was inevitable while much in the spirit of Mill
must necessarily affect deeply all later experientialism. After
Mill experientialism takes essentially new forms. In part because
of what Mill had done. In part also because of what he had left
undone. After Mill means after Kant and Hegel and Herbart,
and it means after the emergence of evolutionary naturalism.
Mill, then, marks the final stage in the achievement of a great
school of thought.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">ii. <i>The Logic of Rationalism.</i></p>

<p>A fundamental contrast to the school of Bacon and of Locke is
afforded by the great systems of reason, owning Cartesian inspiration,
which are identified with the names of Spinoza
and Leibnitz. In the history of logic the latter thinker
<span class="sidenote">Spinoza.</span>
is of the more importance. Spinoza&rsquo;s philosophy is expounded
<i>ordine geometrico</i> and with Euclidean cogency from a relatively
small number of definitions, axioms and postulates. But how
we reach our assurance of the necessity of these principles is not
made specifically clear. The invaluable tractate <i>De Intellectus
emendatione</i>, in which the agreement with and divergence from
Descartes on the question of method could have been fully
elucidated, is unhappily not finished. We know that we need
to pass from what Spinoza terms <i>experientia vaga</i>,<a name="fa121b" id="fa121b" href="#ft121b"><span class="sp">121</span></a> where
imagination with its fragmentary apprehension is liable to error
and neither necessity nor impossibility can be predicated, right up
to that which <i>fictionem terminat</i>&mdash;namely, <i>intellectio</i>. And what
Spinoza has to say of the requisites of definition and the marks of
intellection makes it clear that insight comes with coherence, and
that the work of method on the &ldquo;inductive&rdquo; side is by means
of the unravelling of all that makes for artificial limitation to
lay bare what can then be seen to exhibit nexus in the one great
system. When all is said, however, the geometric method as
universalized in philosophy is rather used by Spinoza than
expounded.</p>

<p>With Leibnitz, on the other hand, the logical problem holds
the foremost place in philosophical inquiry.<a name="fa122b" id="fa122b" href="#ft122b"><span class="sp">122</span></a> From the purely
logical thesis, developed at quite an early stage of his
thinking,<a name="fa123b" id="fa123b" href="#ft123b"><span class="sp">123</span></a> that in any true proposition the predicate is
<span class="sidenote">Leibnitz.</span>
contained in the subject, the main principles of his doctrine of
Monads are derivable with the minimum of help from his
philosophy of dynamics. <i>Praedicatum inest subjecto.</i> All valid
propositions express in the last resort the relation of predicate or
predicates to a subject, and this Leibnitz holds after considering
the case of relational propositions where either term may hold
the position of grammatical subject, A = B and the like. There
is a subject then, or there are subjects which must be recognized
as not possible to be predicated, but as absolute. For reasons
not purely logical Leibnitz declares for the plurality of such
subjects. Each contains all its predicates: and this is true not
only in the case of truths of reason, which are necessary, and
ultimately to be exhibited as coming under the law of contradiction,
&ldquo;or, what comes to the same thing, that of identity,&rdquo;
but also in the case of truths of fact which are contingent, though
a sufficient reason can be given for them which &ldquo;inclines&rdquo; without
importing necessity. The extreme case of course is the human
subject. &ldquo;The individual notion of each person includes once
for all what is to befall it, world without end,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it would not
have been our Adam but another, if he had had other events.&rdquo;
Existent subjects, containing eternally all their successive
predicates in the time-series, are substances, which when the
problems connected with their activity, or dynamically speaking
their force, have been resolved, demand&mdash;and supply&mdash;the
metaphysic of the Monadology.</p>

<p>Complex truths of reason or essence raise the problem of
definition, which consists in their analysis into simpler truths
and ultimately into simple&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> indefinable ideas, with primary
principles of another kind&mdash;axioms, and postulates that neither
need nor admit of proof. These are identical in the sense that
the opposite contains an express contradiction.<a name="fa124b" id="fa124b" href="#ft124b"><span class="sp">124</span></a> In the case of
non-identical truths, too, there is a priori proof drawn from the
notion of the terms, &ldquo;though it is not always in our power to
arrive at this analysis,&rdquo;<a name="fa125b" id="fa125b" href="#ft125b"><span class="sp">125</span></a> so that the question arises, specially
in connexion with the possibility of a calculus, whether the
contingent is reducible to the necessary or identical at the ideal
limit. With much that suggests an affirmative answer, Leibnitz
gives the negative. Even in the case of the Divine will, though
it be always for the best possible, the sufficient reason will
&ldquo;incline without necessitating.&rdquo; The propositions which deal
with actual existence are still of a unique type, with whatever
limitation to the calculus.</p>

<p>Leibnitz&rsquo;s treatment of the primary principles among truths of
reason as identities, and his examples drawn <i>inter alia</i> from the
&ldquo;first principles&rdquo; of mathematics, influenced Kant by antagonism.
Identities some of them manifestly were not. The formula
of identity passed in another form to Herbart and therefore to
Lotze. In recognizing, further, that the relation of an actual
individual fact to its sufficient ground was not reducible to
identity, he set a problem diversely treated by Kant and Herbart.
He brought existential propositions, indeed, within a rational
system through the principle that it must be feasible to assign
a sufficient reason for them, but he refused to bring them under
the conception of identity or necessity, <i>i.e.</i> to treat their opposites
as formally self-contradictory. This bore interest in the Kantian
age in the treatment alike of cause and effect, and of the ontological
proof of existence from essence. Not that the Law of
Sufficient Reason is quite free from equivoque. Propositions
concerning the <i>possible</i> existence of individuals put Leibnitz to
some shifts, and the difficulty accounts for the close connexion
established in regard to our actual world between the law of
sufficient reason and the doctrine of the final cause. This connexion
is something of an afterthought to distinguish from
the potential contingency of the objectively possible the real
contingency of the actual, for which the &ldquo;cause or reason&rdquo; of
Spinoza<a name="fa126b" id="fa126b" href="#ft126b"><span class="sp">126</span></a> could not account. The law, however, is not invalidated
by these considerations, and with the degree of emphasis and the
special setting that Leibnitz gives the law, it is definitely his own.</p>

<p>If we may pass by the doctrine of the Identity of Indiscernibles,
which played a part of some importance in subsequent philosophy,
and the Law of Continuity, which as Leibnitz represents
it is, if not sheer dogma, reached by something very like a fallacy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page911" id="page911"></a>911</span>
we have as Leibnitz&rsquo;s remaining legacy to later logicians the
conception of <i>Characteristica Universalis</i> and <i>Ars Combinatoria</i>,
a universal denoting by symbols and a calculus working by
substitutions and the like. The two positions that a subject
contains all its predicates and that all non-contingent propositions&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
all propositions not concerned with the existence of
individual facts ultimately analyse out into identities&mdash;obviously
lend themselves to the design of this algebra of thought, though
the mathematician in Leibnitz should have been aware that a
significant equation is never an identity. Leibnitz, fresh from the
battle of the calculus in the mathematical field, and with his
conception of logic, at least in some of its aspects, as a generalized
mathematic,<a name="fa127b" id="fa127b" href="#ft127b"><span class="sp">127</span></a> found a fruitful inspiration, harmonizing well with
his own metaphysic, in Bacon&rsquo;s alphabet of nature. He, too, was
prepared to offer a new instrument. That the most important
section, the list of forms of combination, was never achieved&mdash;this
too was after the Baconian example while the mode of
symbolization was crude with <i>a</i> = <i>ab</i> and the like&mdash;matters little.
A new technique of manipulation&mdash;it is, of course, no more&mdash;had
been evolved.</p>

<p>It may be said that among Leibnitz&rsquo;s successors there is no
Leibnitzian. The system as a whole is something too artificial
to secure whole-hearted allegiance. Wolff&rsquo;s formalism is the
bastard outcome of the speculation of Leibnitz, and is related to
it as remotely as Scholasticism is to Aristotle. Wolff found a
sufficient reason for everything and embodied the results of his
inquiries in systematic treatises, sometimes in the vernacular.
He also, by a transparent <i>petitio principii</i>, brought the law of the
sufficient reason under that of non-contradiction. Wolff and
his numerous followers account for the charge of dogmatism
against &ldquo;the Leibnitzio-Wolffian school.&rdquo; They are of importance
in the history of logic for two reasons only: they affected
strongly the German vocabulary of philosophy and they constituted
the intellectual environment in which Kant grew to
manhood.</p>

<p>A truer continuator of Leibnitz in the spirit was Herbart.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">iii. <i>Kant&rsquo;s Logic.</i></p>

<p>Herbart&rsquo;s admitted allegiance, however, was Kantian with
the qualification, at a relatively advanced stage of his thinking,
that it was &ldquo;of the year 1828&rdquo;&mdash;that is, after controversy had
brought out implications of Kant&rsquo;s teaching not wholly contemplated
by Kant himself. The critical philosophy had indeed
made it impossible to hark back to Leibnitz or any other master
otherwise than with a difference.</p>

<p>Yet it is not a single and unambiguous logical movement
that derives from Kant. Kant&rsquo;s lesson was variously understood.
Different moments in it were emphasized, with a large
diversity of result. As interpreted it was acquiesced in or
revolted from and revolt ranged from a desire for some
modifications of detail or expression to the call for a radical
transformation. Grounds for a variety of developments are to
be found in the imperfect harmonization of the rationalistic
heritage from the Wolffian tradition which still dominates Kant&rsquo;s
pure general logic with the manifest epistemological intention of his
transcendental theory. Or again, within the latter in his admission
of a duality of thought and &ldquo;the given&rdquo; in knowledge, which
within knowledge was apparently irreducible, concurrently with
hints as to the possibility, upon a wider view, of the sublation
of their disparateness at least hypothetically and speculatively.
The sense in which there must be a ground of the unity of the
supersensible<a name="fa128b" id="fa128b" href="#ft128b"><span class="sp">128</span></a> while yet the transcendent use of Reason&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
its use beyond the limits of experience was denied theoretical
validity&mdash;was not unnaturally regarded as obscure.</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s treatment of technical logic was wholly traditional, and
in itself is almost negligible. It is comprised<a name="fa129b" id="fa129b" href="#ft129b"><span class="sp">129</span></a> in an early essay
on the mistaken subtlety of the syllogistic figures, and a late
compilation by a pupil from the introductory matter and
<span class="sidenote">Formal Logic.</span>
running annotations with which the master had enriched his
interleaved lecture-room copy of Meyer&rsquo;s <i>Compendium</i> of 1752.
Wolff&rsquo;s general logic, &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; said Kant, &ldquo;that
we possess,&rdquo; had been abridged by Baumgarten and
the abridgment then subjected to commentation
by Meyer. With this traditional body of doctrine Kant was,
save for matters of minor detail, quite content. Logic was of
necessity formal, dealing as it must with those rules without
which no exercise of the understanding would be possible at all.
Upon abstraction from all particular methods of thought these
rules were to be discerned a priori or without dependence on
experience by reflection solely upon the use of the understanding
in general. The science of the form of thought abstracted in
this way from its matter or content was regarded as of value
both as propaedeutic and as canon. It was manifestly one of
the disciplines in which a position of finality was attainable.
Aristotle might be allowed, indeed, to have omitted no essential
point of the understanding, what the moderns had achieved
consisted in an advance in accuracy and methodical completeness.
&ldquo;Indeed, we do not require any new discoverers in logic,&rdquo;<a name="fa130b" id="fa130b" href="#ft130b"><span class="sp">130</span></a>
said the discoverer of a priori synthesis, &ldquo;since it contains merely
the form of thought.&rdquo; Applied logic is merely psychology,
and not properly to be called logic at all. The technical logic
of Kant, then, justifies literally a movement among his successors
in favour of a formal conception of logic with the law of contradiction
and the doctrine of formal implication for its equipment.
Unless the doctrine of Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;transcendental logic&rdquo;
must be held to supply a point of view from which a logical
development of quite another kind is inevitable, Kant&rsquo;s mantle,
so far as logic is concerned, must be regarded as having fallen
upon the formal logicians.</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s transcendental teaching is summarily as follows:
&ldquo;Transcendental&rdquo; is his epithet for what is neither empirical&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
to be derived from experience&mdash;nor yet transcendent&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
applicable beyond the limits of experience,
<span class="sidenote">Definition of &ldquo;Transcendental.&rdquo;</span>
the mark of experience being the implication
of sense or of something which thought contra-distinguishes
from its own spontaneous activity as in some sense
&ldquo;the given.&rdquo; Those features in our organized experience are
to be regarded as transcendentally established which are the
presuppositions of our having that experience at all. Since
they are not empirical they must be structural and belong to
&ldquo;the mind&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the normal human intelligence, and to like
intelligence so far as like. If we set aside such transcendental
conditions as belong to sensibility or to the receptive phase of
mind and are the presuppositions of juxtaposition of parts, the
remainder are ascribable to spontaneity or understanding,
to thought with its unifying, organizing or focussing function,
and their elucidation is the problem of transcendental analytic.
It is still logic, indeed, when we are occupied with the transcendent
objects of the discursive faculty as it is employed beyond
the limits of experience where it cannot validate its ideas.
Such a logic, however, is a dialectic of illusion, perplexed by paralogisms
and helpless in the face of antinomies. In transcendental
analytic on the other hand we concern ourselves only with the
transcendental &ldquo;deduction&rdquo; or vindication of the conditions of
experience, and we have a logic of cognition in which we may
establish our epistemological categories with complete validity.
Categories are the forms according to which the combining unity
of self-consciousness (synthetic unity of apperception) pluralizes
itself through the various functions involved in the constitution
of objectivity in different types of the one act of thought, viz.
judgment. The clue to the discovery of transcendental conditions
Kant finds in the existence of judgments, most manifest in
mathematics and in the pure science of nature, which are certain,
yet not trifling, necessary and yet not reducible to identities,
synthetic therefore and a priori, and so accounted for neither by
Locke nor by Leibnitz. &ldquo;There lies a transcendental condition
at the basis of every necessity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s mode of conceiving the activity of thought in the
constitution of objects and of their connexion in experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page912" id="page912"></a>912</span>
was thought to lie open to an interpretation in conformity with
the spirit of his logic, in the sense that the form and the content
<span class="sidenote">Form of Matter of Thought.</span>
in knowledge are not merely distinguishable functions
within an organic whole, but either separable, or
at least indifferent one to the other in such a way as to
be clearly independent. Thought as form would thus
be a factor or an element in a composite unit. It would clearly
have its own laws. It would be the whole concern of logic,
which, since in it thought has itself for object, would have no
reference to the other term of the antithesis, nor properly and
immediately to the knowledge which is compact of thought
in conjunction with something which, whatever it may be, is
prima facie other than thought. There is too much textual
warrant for this interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s meaning. Doubtless
there are passages which make against an extreme dualistic
interpretation. Even in his &ldquo;logic&rdquo; Kant speaks of abstraction
from all particular objects of thought rather than of a resolution
of concrete thinking into thought and its &ldquo;other&rdquo; as separable
co-operating factors in a joint product. He spoke throughout,
however, as if form and content were mutually indifferent, so
that the abstraction of form from content implied nothing of
falsification or mutilation. The reserve, therefore, that it was
abstraction and not a decomposing that was in question remained
to the admirers of his logic quite nugatory. They failed to
realize that permissible abstraction from specific contents or
methods of knowledge does not obliterate reference to matter
or content. They passed easily from the acceptance of a priori
forms of thinking to that of forms of a priori thinking, and could
plead the example of Kant&rsquo;s logic.</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s theory of knowledge, then, needed to be pressed to
other consequences for logic which were more consonant with the
spirit of the <i>Critique</i>. The forms of thought and what gives
thought its particular content in concrete acts of thinking could
not be regarded as subsisting in a purely external and indifferent
relation one to the other. &ldquo;Laws according to which the
subject thinks&rdquo; and &ldquo;laws according to which the object is
known&rdquo; cannot be the concern of separate departments of
inquiry. As soon divorce the investigation of the shape and
material of a mirror from the laws of the incidence of the rays that
form images in it, and call it a science of reflection! An important
group of writers developed the conception of an adaptation
between the two sides of Kant&rsquo;s antithesis, and made the
endeavour to establish some kind of correlation between logical
forms and the process of &ldquo;the given.&rdquo; There was a tendency to
fall back upon the conception of some kind of parallelism,
whether it was taken to be interpretative or rather corrective
of Kant&rsquo;s meaning. This device was never remote from the
constructions of writers for whom the teaching of Spinoza and
Leibnitz was an integral part of their intellectual equipment.
Other modes of correlation, however, find favour also, and in
some variety. Kant is seldom the sole source of inspiration. His
unresolved antithesis<a name="fa131b" id="fa131b" href="#ft131b"><span class="sp">131</span></a> is interpreted either diversely or with a
difference of emphasis. And the light that later writers bring to
bear on Kant&rsquo;s logic and epistemology from other sides of his
speculation varies in kind and in degree.</p>

<p>Another logical movement springs from those whom a correlation
of fact within the unity of a system altogether failed to
satisfy. There must also be development of the correlated terms
from a single principle. Form and content must not only correspond
one to the other. They must be exhibited as distinguishable
moments within a unity which can at one and the same
time be seen to be the ground from which the distinction springs
and the ground in virtue of which it is over-ruled. Along this line
of speculation we have a logic which claims that whatsoever
is in one plane or at one stage in the development of thought a
residuum that apparently defies analysis must at another stage
and on a higher plane be shown so to be absorbed as to fall
altogether within thought. This is the view of Hegel upon
which logic comes to coincide with the progressive self-unfolding
of thought in that type of metaphysic which is known as absolute,
<i>i.e.</i> all-inclusive idealism. The exponent of logic as metaphysic,
for whom the rational is the real is necessarily in revolt against
all that is characteristically Kantian in the theory of knowledge,
against the transcendental method itself and against the doctrine
of limits which constitutes the nerve of &ldquo;criticism.&rdquo; Stress was
to be laid upon the constructive character of the act of thought
which Kant had recognized, and without Kant&rsquo;s qualifications of
it. In all else the claim is made to have left the Kantian teaching
behind as a cancelled level of speculation.</p>

<p>Transcendental method is indeed not invulnerable. A principle
is transcendentally &ldquo;deduced&rdquo; when it and only it can explain
the validity of some phase of experience, some order
of truths. The order of truths, the phase of experience
<span class="sidenote">Limitation of Transcendental Method.</span>
and its certainty had to be taken for granted. The
sense, for example, in which the irreversibility of
sequence which is the more known <i>in ordine ad hominem</i> in the
case of the causal principle differs from merely psychological
conviction is not made fully clear. Even so the inference to the
a priori ground of its necessity is, it has been often pointed out,
subject to the limitation inherent in any process of reduction,
in any regress, that is, from conditionate to condition, viz. that
in theory an alternative is still possible. The inferred principle
may hold the field as explanation without obvious competitor
potential or actual. Nevertheless its claim to be the sole possible
explanation can in nowise be validated. It has been established
after all by dialectic in the Aristotelian sense of the word. But
if transcendental method has no special pride of place, Kant&rsquo;s
conclusion as to the limits of the competence of intellectual
faculty falls with it. Cognition manifestly needs the help of
Reason even in its theoretical use. Its speculation can no longer
be stigmatized as vaticination <i>in vacuo</i>, nor its results as illusory.</p>

<p>Finally, to logic as metaphysic the polar antithesis is psychology
as logic. The turn of this also was to come again. If logic were
treated as merely formal, the stress of the problem
of knowledge fell upon the determination of the
<span class="sidenote">Logic and Psychology.</span>
processes of the psychological mechanism. If alleged
a priori constituents of knowledge&mdash;such rubrics as
substance, property, relation&mdash;come to be explained psychologically,
the formal logic that has perforce to ignore all that
belongs to psychology is confined within too narrow a range to
be able to maintain its place as an independent discipline, and
tends to be merged in psychology. This tendency is to be seen in
the activity of Fries and Herbart and Beneke, and was actualized
as the aftermath of their speculation. It is no accident that it
was the psychology of apperception and the voluntaryist theory
or practice of Herbart, whose logical theory was so closely allied
to that of the formal logicians proper, that contributed most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page913" id="page913"></a>913</span>
to the development of the post-Kantian psychological logic.
Another movement helped also; the exponents of naturalistic
evolution were prepared with Spencer to explain the so-called
<i>a priori</i> in knowledge as in truth <i>a posteriori</i>, if not to the
individual at any rate to the race. It is of course a newer type
of psychological logic that is in question, one that is aware of
Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;answer to Hume.&rdquo; Stuart Mill, despite of his relation
of antagonism to Hamilton and Mansel, who held themselves to
be Kantian in spirit, is still wholly pre-Kantian in his outlook.</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s influence, then, upon subsequent logic is least of all
to be measured by his achievement in his professed contribution
to technical logic. It may be attributed in some
slight degree, perhaps, to incidental flashes of logical
<span class="sidenote">Summary.</span>
insight where his thought is least of what he himself calls logic,
<i>e.g.</i> his exposition of the significance of synthetic judgments
<i>a priori</i>, or his explanation of the function of imagery in relation
to thought, whereby he offers a solution of the problem of the
conditions under which one member of a group unified through
a concept can be taken to stand for the rest, or again the way
in which he puts his finger on the vital issue in regard to the
alleged proof from essence to existence, and illustrations could
be multiplied. But much more it belongs to his transformation
of the epistemological problem, and to the suggestiveness of his
philosophy as a whole for an advance in the direction of a
speculative construction which should be able to cancel all Kant&rsquo;s
surds, and in particular vindicate a &ldquo;ground of the unity of the
supersensible which lies back of nature with that which the
concept of freedom implies in the sphere of practice,&rdquo;<a name="fa132b" id="fa132b" href="#ft132b"><span class="sp">132</span></a> which is
what Kant finally asserts.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">iv. <i>After Kant.</i></p>

<p>Starting from the obvious antithesis of thought and that of
which it is the thought, it is possible to view the ultimate relation
of its term as that of mutual indifference or, secondly, as that of
a correspondence such that while they retain their distinct
character modification of the one implies modification of the
other, or thirdly and lastly, as that of a mergence of one in the
other of such a nature that the merged term, whichever it be,
is fully accounted for in a complete theory of that in which it is
merged.</p>

<p>The first way is that of the purely formal logicians, of whom
Twesten<a name="fa133b" id="fa133b" href="#ft133b"><span class="sp">133</span></a> and in England H. L. Mansel may be regarded as
typical. They take thought and &ldquo;the given&rdquo; as
self-contained units which, if not in fact separable, are
<span class="sidenote">The Formal Logicians.</span>
at any rate susceptible of an abstraction the one from
the other so decisive as to constitute an ideal separation. The
laws of the pure activity of thought must be independently
determined, and since the contribution of thought to knowledge
is form they must be formal only. They cannot go beyond the
limits of formal consistency or analytic correctness. They are
confined to the determination of what the truth of any matter
of thought, taken for granted upon grounds psychological or
other, which are extraneous to logic, includes or excludes. The
unit for logic is the concept taken for granted. The function
of logic is to exhibit its formal implications and repulsions.
It is questionable whether even this modest task could be really
achieved without other reference to the content abstracted from
than Mansel, for example, allows. The analogy of the resolution
of a chemical compound with its elements which is often on the
lips of those who would justify the independence of thought and
the real world, with an agnostic conclusion as to non-phenomenal
or trans-subjective reality, is not really applicable. The oxygen
and hydrogen, for example, into which water may be resolved
are not in strictness indifferent one to the other, since both are
members of an order regulated according to laws of combination
in definite ratios. Or, if applicable, it is double-edged. Suppose
oxygen to be found only in water. Were it to become conscious,
would it therefore follow that it could infer the laws of a separate
or independent activity of its own? Similarly forms of thinking,
the law of contradiction not excepted, have their meaning only
in reference to determinate content, even though distributively
all determinate contents are dispensable. The extreme formalist
is guilty of a fallacy of composition in regard to abstraction.</p>

<p>It does not follow, however, that the laws asserted by the
formal logicians are invalid or unimportant. There is a permissible
abstraction, and in general they practise this, and
although they narrow its range unduly, it is legitimately to be
applied to certain characters of thinking. As the living organism
includes something of mechanism&mdash;the skeleton, for example&mdash;so
an organic logic doubtless includes determinations of formal
consistency. The skeleton is meaningless apart from reference
to its function in the life of an organism, yet there are laws of
skeleton structure which can be studied with most advantage if
other characters of the organism are relegated to the background.
To allow, however, that abstraction admits of degrees, and that it
never obliterates all reference to that from which it is abstracted,
is to take a step forward in the direction of the correlation of
logical forms with the concrete processes of actual thinking.
What was true in formal logic tended to be absorbed in the
correlationist theories.</p>

<p>Those formal logicians of the Kantian school, then, may be
summarily dismissed, though their undertaking was a necessary
one, who failed to raise the epistemological issue at all, or who,
raising it, acquiesced in a naïve dualism agnostic of the real
world as Kant&rsquo;s essential lesson. They failed to develop any
view which could serve either in fact or in theory as a corrective
to the effect of their formalism. What they said with justice
was said as well or better elsewhere.</p>

<p>Among them it is on the whole impossible not to include the
names of Hamilton and Mansel. The former, while his erudition
in respect to the history of philosophical opinion has rarely been
equalled, was not a clear thinker. His general theory of knowledge
deriving from Kant and Reid, and including among other
things a <i>contaminatio</i> of their theories of perception,<a name="fa134b" id="fa134b" href="#ft134b"><span class="sp">134</span></a> in no way
sustains or mitigates his narrow view of logic. He makes no
effective use of his general formula that to think is to condition.
He appeals to the direct testimony of consciousness in the sense
in which the appeal involves a fallacy. He accepts an ultimate
antinomy as to the finiteness or infinity of &ldquo;the unconditioned,&rdquo;
yet applies the law of the excluded middle to insist that one of
the two alternatives must be true, wherefore we must make the
choice. And what is to be said of the judgment of a writer who
considers the relativity of thought demonstrated by the fact
that every judgment unites two members? Hamilton&rsquo;s significance
for the history of logic lies in the stimulus that he gave
to the development of symbolic logic in England by his new
analytic based upon his discovery or adoption of the principle
of the quantification of the predicate. Mansel, too, was learned,
specially in matters of Aristotelian exegesis, and much that is
of value lies buried in his commentation of the dry bones of the
<i>Artis Logicae Rudimenta</i> of Locke&rsquo;s contemporary Aldrich. And
he was a clearer thinker than Hamilton. Formal logic of the
extremest rigour is nowhere to be found more adequately expressed
in all its strength, and it must be added in all its weakness,
than in the writings of Mansel. But if the view maintained above
that formal logic must compromise or mitigate its rigour and
so fail to maintain its independence, be correct, the logical
consistency of Mansel&rsquo;s logic of consistency does but emphasize
its barrenness. It contains no germ for further development.
It is the end of a movement.</p>

<p>The brief logic of Herbart<a name="fa135b" id="fa135b" href="#ft135b"><span class="sp">135</span></a> is altogether formal too. Logical
forms have for him neither psychological nor metaphysical
reference, we are concerned in logic solely with the systematic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page914" id="page914"></a>914</span>
clarification of concepts which are wholly abstract, so that
<span class="sidenote">Herbart.</span>
they are not merely not ultimate realities, but also in no
sense actual moments of our concrete thinking. The
first task of logic is to distinguish and group such concepts
according to their marks, and from their classification there
naturally follows their connexion in judgment. It is in the
logic of judgment that Herbart inaugurates a new era. He is
not, of course, the first to note that even categorical judgments
do not assert the realization of their subject. That is a thought
which lies very near the surface for formal logic. He had been
preceded too by Maimon in the attempt at a reduction of the
traditional types of judgment. He was, however, the first whose
analysis was sufficiently convincing to exorcise the tyranny of
grammatical forms. The categorical and disjunctive judgment
reduce to the hypothetical. By means of the doctrine of the
quantification of the predicate, in which with his Leibnitzian
conception of identity he anticipated Beneke and Hamilton
alike, universal and particular judgments are made to pull
together. Modal, impersonal, existential judgments are all
accounted for. Only the distinction of affirmative and negative
judgments remains unresolved, and the exception is a natural
one from the point of view of a philosophy of pluralism. There
was little left to be done here save in the way of an inevitable
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, even by Lotze and F. H. Bradley. From the
judgment viewed as hypothetical we pass by affirmation of the
antecedent or denial of the consequent to inference. This point
of departure is noteworthy, as also is the treatment of the
inductive syllogism as one in which the middle term is resoluble
into a group or series (<i>Reihe</i>). In indicating specifically, too, the
case of conclusion from a copulative major premise with a disjunctive
minor, Herbart seems to have suggested the cue for
Sigwart&rsquo;s exposition of Bacon&rsquo;s method of exclusions.</p>

<p>That it was the formal character of Herbart&rsquo;s logic which was
ultimately fatal to its acceptance outside the school as an independent
discipline is not to be doubted. It stands, however, on
a different footing from that of the formal logic hitherto discussed,
and is not to be condemned upon quite the same grounds. In
the first place, Herbart is quite aware of the nature of abstraction.
In the second, there is no claim that thought at one and the
same time imposes form on &ldquo;the given&rdquo; and is susceptible of
treatment in isolation by logic. With Herbart the forms of
common experience, and indeed all that we can regard as his
categories, are products of the psychological mechanism and
destitute of logical import. And lastly, Herbart&rsquo;s logic conforms
to the exigencies of his system as a whole and the principle of the
bare or absolute self-identity of the ultimate &ldquo;reals&rdquo; in particular.
It is for this reason that it finally lacks real affinity to the &ldquo;pure
logic&rdquo; of Fries. For at the basis of Herbart&rsquo;s speculation there
lies a conception of identity foreign to the thought of Kant with
his stress on synthesis, in his thoroughgoing metaphysical use of
which Herbart goes back not merely to Wolff but to Leibnitz.
It is no mere coincidence that his treatment of all forms of continuance
and even his positive metaphysic of &ldquo;reals&rdquo; show
affinity to Leibnitz. It was in the pressing to its extreme consequences
of the conception of uncompromising identity which is
to be found in Leibnitz, that the contradictions took their rise
which Herbart aimed at solving, by the method of relations and
his doctrine of the ultimate plurality of &ldquo;reals.&rdquo; The logic of
relations between conceptual units, themselves unaltered by the
relation, seems a kind of reflection of his metaphysical method.
To those, of course, for whom the only real identity is identity in
difference, while identity without difference, like difference without
identity, is simply a limit or a vanishing point, Herbart&rsquo;s
logic and metaphysic will alike lack plausibility.</p>

<p>The setting of Herbart&rsquo;s logic in his thought as a whole might
of itself perhaps justify separate treatment. His far-reaching
influence in the development of later logic must certainly do so.
Directly he affected a school of thought which contained one
logician of first-rate importance in Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch
(1802-1896), professor at Leipzig. In less direct relation stands
Lotze, who, although under other influences he developed a
different view even in logic, certainly let no point in the doctrine
of his great predecessor at Göttingen escape him. A Herbartian
strain is to be met with also in the thought of writers much
further afield, for example F. H. Bradley, far though his metaphysic
is removed from Herbart&rsquo;s. Herbart&rsquo;s influence is surely
to be found too in the evolution of what is called <i>Gegenstandstheorie</i>.
Nor did he affect the logic of his successors through his
logic alone. Reference has been made above to the effect upon
the rise of the later psychological logic produced by Herbart&rsquo;s
psychology of apperception, when disengaged from the background
of his metaphysic taken in conjunction with his treatment
in his practical philosophy of the judgment of value or what he
calls the aesthetic judgment. Emerson&rsquo;s verdict upon a greater
thinker&mdash;that his was &ldquo;not a mind to nestle in&rdquo;&mdash;may be true
of Herbart, but there can be no doubt as to the stimulating
force of this master.</p>

<p>The second way of interpreting the antithesis of thought to
what is thought of, was taken by a group of thinkers among
whom a central and inspiring figure was Schleiermacher.
They in no sense constitute a school and manifest
<span class="sidenote">Logic as the rationale of knowledge.</span>
radical differences among themselves. They are
agreed, however, in the rejection, on the one hand, of
the subjectivist logic with its intrinsic implication that
knowledge veils rather than reveals the real world, and, on the
other hand, of the logic of the speculative construction with its
pretension to &ldquo;deduce,&rdquo; to determine, and finally at once to
cancel and conserve any antithesis in its all-embracing dialectic.
They agree, then, in a maintenance of the critical point of view,
while all alike recognize the necessity of bringing the thought-function
in knowledge into more intimate relation with its
&ldquo;other&rdquo; than Kant had done, by means of some formula of
correlation or parallelism. Such an advance might have taken
its cue directly from Kant himself. As an historical fact it tended
rather to formulate itself as a reaction towards Kant in view of
the course taken by the speculative movement. Thus Schleiermacher&rsquo;s
posthumously published <i>Dialektik</i> (1839) may be
characterized as an appeal from the absolutist element in
Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy to the conception of that correlation or
parallelism which Schelling had exhibited as flowing from and
subsisting within his absolute, and therein as a return upon
<span class="sidenote">Schleiermacher.</span>
Kant&rsquo;s doctrine of limits. Schleiermacher&rsquo;s conception
of dialectic is to the effect that it is concerned with the
principles of the art of philosophizing, as these are
susceptible of a relatively independent treatment by a permissible
abstraction. Pure thinking or philosophizing is with a view to
philosophy or knowledge as an interconnected system of all
sciences or departmental forms of knowledge, the mark of knowledge
being its identity for all thinking minds. Dialectic then
investigates the nexus which must be held to obtain between all
thoughts, but also that agreement with the nexus in being
which is the condition of the validity of the thought-nexus.
In knowing there are two functions involved, the &ldquo;organic&rdquo; or
animal function of sensuous experience in virtue of which we
are in touch with being, directly in inner perception, mediately
in outer experience, and the &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; function of construction.
Either is indispensable, though in different departments
of knowledge the predominant rôle falls to one or other, <i>e.g.</i> we
are more dependent in physics, less so in ethics. The idea of
a perfect harmony of thinking and being is a presupposition that
underlies all knowing but cannot itself be realized in knowledge.
In terms of the agreement of thought and being, the logical forms
of the part of dialectic correspondent to knowledge statically
considered have parallels and analogies in being, the concept
being correlated to substance, the judgment to causal nexus.
Inference, curiously enough, falls under the technical side of
dialectic concerned with knowledge in process or becoming, a line
of cleavage which Ueberweg has rightly characterized as constituting
a rift within Schleiermacher&rsquo;s parallelism.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher&rsquo;s formula obviously ascribes a function in
knowledge to thought as such, and describes in a suggestive
manner a duality of the intellectual and organic functions,
resting on a parallelism of thought and being whose collapse into
identity it is beyond human capacity to grasp. It is rather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page915" id="page915"></a>915</span>
however, a statement of a way in which the relations of the terms
of the problem may be conceived than a system of necessity.
It may indeed be permitted to doubt whether its influence upon
subsequent theory would have been a great one apart from the
spiritual force of Schleiermacher&rsquo;s personality. Some sort of
correlationist conception, however, was an inevitable development,
and the list<a name="fa136b" id="fa136b" href="#ft136b"><span class="sp">136</span></a> of those who accepted it in something of the
spirit of Schleiermacher is a long one and contains many distinguished
names, notably those of Trendelenburg and Ueberweg.
The group is loosely constituted however. There was scope for
diversity of view and there was diversity of view, according as
the vital issue of the formula was held to lie in the relation of
intellectual function to organic function or in the not quite
equivalent relation of thinking to being. Moreover, few of the
writers who, whatsoever it was that they baptized with the name
of logic, were at least earnestly engaged in an endeavour to solve
the problem of knowledge within a circle of ideas which was on
the whole Kantian, were under the dominance of a single inspiration.
Beneke&rsquo;s philosophy is a striking instance of this,
with application to Fries and affinity to Herbart conjoined with
obligations to Schelling both directly and through Schleiermacher.
Lotze again wove together many threads of earlier
thought, though the web was assuredly his own. Finally it
must not be forgotten that the host of writers who were in
reaction against Hegelianism tended to take refuge in some
formula of correlation, as a half-way house between that and
formalism or psychologism or both, without reference to, and
often perhaps without consciousness of, the way in which
historically it had taken shape to meet the problem held to have
been left unresolved by Kant.</p>

<p>Lotze on the one hand held the Hegelian &ldquo;deduction&rdquo; to be
untenable, and classed himself with those who in his own phrase
&ldquo;passed to the order of the day,&rdquo; while on the other
hand he definitely raised the question, how an &ldquo;object&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Lotze.</span>
could be brought into forms to which it was not in some sense
adapted. Accordingly, though he regards logic as formal, its
forms come into relation to objectivity in some sort even within
the logical field itself, while when taken in the setting of his
system as a whole, its formal character is not of a kind that
ultimately excludes psychological and metaphysical reference,
at least speculatively. As a logician Lotze stands among the
masters. His <i>flair</i> for the essentials in his problem, his subtlety
of analysis, his patient willingness to return upon a difficulty
from a fresh and still a fresh point of view, and finally his fineness
of judgment, make his logic<a name="fa137b" id="fa137b" href="#ft137b"><span class="sp">137</span></a> so essentially logic of the present,
and of its kind not soon to be superseded, that nothing more than
an indication of the historical significance of some of its characteristic
features need be attempted here.</p>

<p>In Lotze&rsquo;s pure logic it is the Herbartian element that tends
to be disconcerting. Logic is formal. Its unit, the logical concept,
is a manipulated product and the process of manipulation
may be called abstraction. Processes of the psychological
mechanism lie below it. The paradox of the theory of judgment
is due to the ideal of identity, and the way in which this is
evaded by supplementation to produce a non-judgmental
identity, followed by translation of the introduced accessories
with conditions in the hypothetical judgment, is thoroughly
in Herbart&rsquo;s manner. The reduction of judgments is on lines
already familiar. Syllogism is no instrumental method by which
we compose our knowledge, but an ideal to the form of which
it should be brought. It is, as it were, a schedule to be filled
in, and is connected with the disjunctive judgment as a schematic
setting forth of alternatives, not with the hypothetical, and
ultimately the apodictic judgment with their suggestion that
it is the real movement of thought that is subjected to analysis.
Yet the resultant impression left by the whole treatment is not
Herbartian. The concept is accounted for in Kantian terms.
There is no discontinuity between the pre-logical or sub-logical
conversion of impressions into &ldquo;first universals&rdquo; and the
formation of the logical concept. Abstraction proves to be
synthesis with compensatory universal marks in the place of the
particular marks abstracted from. Synthesis as the work of
thought always supplies, beside the mere conjunction or disjunction
of ideas, a ground of their coherence or non-coherence. It
is evident that thought, even as dealt with in pure logic, has
an objectifying function. Its universals have objective validity,
though this does not involve direct real reference. The formal
conception of pure logic, then, is modified by Lotze in such a
way as not only to be compatible with a view of the structural
and functional adequacy of thought to that which at every
point at which we take thinking is still distinguishable from
thought, but even inevitably to suggest it. That the unit for
logic is the concept and not the judgment has proved a stumbling-block
to those of Lotze&rsquo;s critics who are accustomed to think
in terms of the act of thought as unit. Lotze&rsquo;s procedure is,
indeed, analogous to the way in which, in his philosophy of
nature, he starts from a plurality of real beings, but by means
of a reductive movement, an application of Kant&rsquo;s transcendental
method, arrives at the postulate or fact of a law of their reciprocal
action which calls for a monistic and idealist interpretation.
He starts, that is in logic, with conceptual units apparently
self-contained and admitting of nothing but external relation,
but proceeds to justify the intrinsic relation between the matter
of his units by an appeal to the fact of the coherence of all contents
of thought. Indeed, if thought admits irreducible units, what
can unite? Yet he is left committed to his puzzle as to a
reduction of judgment to identity, which partially vitiates
his treatment of the theory of judgment. The outstanding
feature of this is, nevertheless, not affected, viz. the attempt
that he makes, inspired clearly by Hegel, &ldquo;to develop the various
forms of judgment systematically as members of a series of operations,
each of which leaves a part of its problem unmastered
and thereby gives rise to the next.&rdquo;<a name="fa138b" id="fa138b" href="#ft138b"><span class="sp">138</span></a> As to inference, finally,
the ideal of the articulation of the universe of discourse, as it
is for complete knowledge, when its disjunctions have been
thoroughly followed out and it is exhaustively determined,
carried the day with him against the view that the organon
for gaining knowledge is syllogism. The Aristotelian formula
is &ldquo;merely the expression, formally expanded and complete,
of the truth already embodied in disjunctive judgment, namely,
that every S which is a specific form of M possesses as its predicate
a particular modification of each of the universal predicates of
M to the exclusion of the rest.&rdquo; Schleiermacher&rsquo;s separation
of inference from judgment and his attribution of the power
to knowledge in process cannot find acceptance with Lotze.
The psychologist and the formal logician do indeed join hands
in the denial of a real movement of thought in syllogism. Lotze&rsquo;s
logic then, is formal in a sense in which a logic which does not
find the conception of synthetic truth embarrassing is not so.
It is canon and not organon. In the one case, however, where
it recognizes what is truly synthesis, <i>i.e.</i> in its account of the
concept, it brings the statics of knowledge, so to speak, into
integral relation with the dynamics. And throughout, wherever
the survival from 1843, the identity bug-bear, is for the moment
got rid of in what is really a more liberal conception, the statical
doctrine is developed in a brilliant and informing manner. Yet
it is in the detail of his logical investigations, something too
volatile to fix in summary, that Lotze&rsquo;s greatness as a logician
more especially lies.</p>

<p>With Lotze the ideal that at last the forms of thought shall
be realized to be adequate to that which at any stage of actual
knowledge always proves relatively intractable is an illuminating
projection of faith. He takes courage from the reflection that
to accept scepticism is to presume the competence of the thought
that accepts. He will, however, take no easy way of parallelism.
Our human thought pursues devious and circuitous methods.
Its forms are not unseldom scaffolding for the house of knowledge
rather than the framework of the house itself. Our task is not
to realise correspondence with something other than thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page916" id="page916"></a>916</span>
but to make explicit those justificatory notions which condition
the form of our apprehension. &ldquo;However much we may
presuppose an original reference of the forms of thought to that
nature of things which is the goal of knowledge, we must be prepared
to find in them many elements which do not directly reproduce
the actual reality to the knowledge of which they are to lead
us.&rdquo;<a name="fa139b" id="fa139b" href="#ft139b"><span class="sp">139</span></a> The impulse of thought to reduce coincidence to coherence
reaches immediately only to objectivity or validity. The sense
in which the presupposition of a further reference is to be interpreted
and in which justificatory notions for it can be adduced
is only determinable in a philosophic system as a whole, where
feeling has a place as well as thought, value equally with validity.</p>

<p>Lotze&rsquo;s logic then represents the statical aspect of the function
of thought in knowledge, while, so far as we go in knowledge
thought is always engaged in the unification of a manifold, which
remains contradistinguished from it, though not, of course,
completely alien to and unadapted to it. The further step to the
determination of the ground of harmony is not to be taken in
logic, where limits are present and untranscended.</p>

<p>The position of the search for truth, for which knowledge is a
growing organism in which thought needs, so to speak, to feed
on something other than itself, is conditioned in the
post-Kantian period by antagonism to the speculative
<span class="sidenote">Logic as Metaphysic.</span>
movement which culminated in the dialectic of Hegel.
The radical thought of this movement was voiced in
the demand of Reinhold<a name="fa140b" id="fa140b" href="#ft140b"><span class="sp">140</span></a> that philosophy should &ldquo;deduce&rdquo;
it all from a single principle and by a single method. Kant&rsquo;s
limits that must needs be thought and yet cannot be thought
must be thought away. An earnest attempt to satisfy this
demand was made by Fichte whose single principle was the
activity of the pure Ego, while his single method was the assertion
of a truth revealed by reflection on the content of conscious
experience, the characterization of this as a half truth and the
supplementation of it by its other, and finally the harmonization
of both. The pure ego is inferred from the fact that the non-ego
is realized only in the act of the ego in positing it. The ego
posits itself, but reflection on the given shows that we must add
that it posits also the non-ego. The two positions are to be
conciliated in the thought of reciprocal limitation of the posited
ego and non-ego. And so forth. Fichte cannot be said to have
developed a logic, but this rhythm of thesis, antithesis and
synthesis, foreshadowed in part for Fichte in Spinoza&rsquo;s formula,
&ldquo;omnis determinatio est negatio&rdquo; and significantly in Kant&rsquo;s
triadic grouping of his categories, gave a cue to the thought of
Hegel. Schelling, too, called for a single principle and claimed
to have found it in his Absolute, &ldquo;the night&rdquo; said Hegel, &ldquo;in
which all cows are black,&rdquo; but his historical influence lay, as we
have seen, in the direction of a parallelism within the unity, and
he also developed no logic. It is altogether otherwise with Hegel.</p>

<p>Hegel&rsquo;s logic,<a name="fa141b" id="fa141b" href="#ft141b"><span class="sp">141</span></a> though it involves inquiries which custom
regards as metaphysical, is not to be characterized as a metaphysic
with a method. It is logic or a rationale of
thought by thought, with a full development among
<span class="sidenote">Hegel.</span>
other matters of all that the most separatist of logicians regards
as thought forms. It offers a solution of what has throughout
appeared as the logical problem. That solution lies doubtless
in the evolution of the Idea, <i>i.e.</i> an all-inclusive in which mere
or pure thought is cancelled in its separateness by a transfiguration,
while logic is nothing but the science of the Idea viewed in
the medium of pure thought. But, whatever else it be, this
<i>Panlogismus</i>, to use the word of J. E. Erdmann, is at least a
logic. Thought in its progressive unfolding, of which the history
of philosophy taken in its broad outline offers a pageant, necessarily
cannot find anything external to or alien from itself,
though that there is something external for it is another matter.
As Fichte&rsquo;s Ego finds that its <i>non-ego</i> springs from and has its
home within its very self, so with Hegel thought finds itself in
its &ldquo;other,&rdquo; both subsisting in the Idea which is both and
neither. Either of the two is the all, as, for example, the law
of the convexity of the curve is the law of the curve and the law
of its concavity. The process of the development of the Idea or
Absolute is in one regard the immanent process of the all. Logically
regarded, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;in the medium of mere thought,&rdquo; it is
dialectical method. Any abstract and limited point of view
carries necessarily to its contradictory. This can only be atoned
with the original determination by fresh negation in which a
new thought-determination is born, which is yet in a sense the
old, though enriched, and valid on a higher plane. The limitations
of this in turn cause a contradiction to emerge, and the
process needs repetition. At last, however, no swing into the
opposite, with its primarily conflicting, if ultimately complementary
function, is any longer possible. That in which no
further contradiction is possible is the absolute Idea. Bare or
indeterminate being, for instance, the first of the determinations
of Hegel&rsquo;s logic, as the being of that which is not anything
determinate, of Kant&rsquo;s thing-in-itself, for example, positively
understood, implicated at once the notion of not-being, which
negates it, and is one with it, yet with a difference, so that we
have the transition to determinate being, the transition being
baptized as becoming. And so forth. It is easy to raise difficulties
not only in regard to the detail in Hegel&rsquo;s development of
his categories, especially the higher ones, but also in regard to
the essential rhythm of his method. The consideration that mere
double negation leaves us precisely where we were and not upon
a higher plane where the dominant concept is richer, is, of course,
fatal only to certain verbal expressions of Hegel&rsquo;s intent. There
is a differentiation in type between the two negations. But if
we grant this it is no longer obviously the simple logical operation
indicated. It is inferred then that Hegel complements from the
stuff of experience, and fails to make good the pretension of his
method to be by itself and of itself the means of advance to higher
and still higher concepts till it can rest in the Absolute. He
discards, as it were, and takes in from the stock while professing
to play from what he has originally in his hand. He postulates
his unity in senses and at stages in which it is inadmissible, and
so supplies only a schema of relations otherwise won, a view
supported by the way in which he injects certain determinations
in the process, <i>e.g.</i> the category of chemism. Has he not cooked
the process in the light of the result? In truth the Hegelian
logic suffers from the fact that the good to be reached is presupposed
in the beginning. Nature, <i>e.g.</i>, is not deduced as real
because rational, but being real its rationality is presumed and,
very imperfectly, exhibited in a way to make it possible to conceive
it as in its essence the reflex of Reason. It is a vision rather
than a construction. It is a &ldquo;theosophical logic.&rdquo; Consider
the rational-real in the unity that must be, and this is the way
of it, or an approximation to the way of it! It was inevitable that
the epistemologists of the search for truth would have none of
it. The ideal in whatsoever sense real still needs to be realized.
It is from the human standpoint regulative and only hypothetically
or formally constitutive. We must not confuse <span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span> with
<span class="grk" title="einai">&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>, nor <span class="grk" title="einai">&#949;&#7990;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> with <span class="grk" title="gignesthai">&#947;&#943;&#947;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>Yet in a less ambitious form the fundamental contentions of
Hegel&rsquo;s method tend to find a qualified acceptance. In any piece
of presumed knowledge its partial or abstract character involves
the presence of loose edges which force the conviction of inadequacy
and the development of contradictions. Contradictions
must be annulled by complementation, with resultant
increasing coherence in ascending stages. At each successive
stage in our progress fresh contradictions break out, but the
ideal of a station at which the thought-process and its other, if
not one, are at one, is permissible as a limiting conception. Yet
if Hegel meant only this he has indeed succeeded in concealing
his meaning.</p>

<p>Hegel&rsquo;s treatment of the categories or thought determinations
which arise in the development of the immanent dialectic is
rich in flashes of insight, but most of them are in the ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page917" id="page917"></a>917</span>
view of logic wholly metaphysical. In the stage, however, of his
process in which he is concerned with the notion are to be found
concept, judgment, syllogism. Of the last he declares that it
&ldquo;is the reasonable and everything reasonable&rdquo; (<i>Encyk.</i> § 181),
and has the phantasy to speak of the definition of the Absolute as
being &ldquo;at this stage&rdquo; simply the syllogism. It is, of course, the
rhythm of the syllogism that attracts him. The concept goes
out from or utters itself in judgment to return to an enhanced
unity in syllogism. Ueberweg (<i>System</i> § 101) is, on the whole,
justified in exclaiming that Hegel&rsquo;s rehabilitation of syllogism
&ldquo;did but slight service to the Aristotelian theory of syllogism,&rdquo;
yet his treatment of syllogism must be regarded as an acute contribution
to logical criticism in the technical sense. He insists on
its objectivity. The transition from judgment is not brought
about by our subjective action. The syllogism of &ldquo;all-ness&rdquo; is
convicted of a <i>petitio principii</i> (<i>Encyk.</i> § 190), with consequent
lapse into the inductive syllogism, and, finally, since inductive
syllogism is involved in the infinite process, into analogy.
&ldquo;The syllogism of necessity,&rdquo; on the contrary, does not presuppose
its conclusion in its premises. The detail, too, of the whole
discussion is rich in suggestion, and subsequent logicians&mdash;Ueberweg
himself perhaps, Lotze certainly in his genetic scale
of types of judgment and inference, Professor Bosanquet notably
in his systematic development of &ldquo;the morphology of knowledge,&rdquo;
and others&mdash;have with reason exploited it.</p>

<p>Hegel&rsquo;s logic as a whole, however, stands and falls not with his
thoughts on syllogism, but with the claim made for the dialectical
method that it exhibits logic in its integral unity with metaphysic,
the thought-process as the self-revelation of the Idea. The claim
was disallowed. To the formalist proper it was self-condemned
in its pretension to develop the content of thought and its
rejection of the formula of bare-identity. To the epistemologist
it seemed to confuse foundation and keystone, and to suppose
itself to build upon the latter in a construction illegitimately
appropriative of materials otherwise accumulated. At most it
was thought to establish a schema of formal unity which might
serve as a regulative ideal. To the methodologist of science in
genesis it appeared altogether to fail to satisfy any practical
interest. Finally, to the psychologist it spelt the failure of
intellectualism, and encouraged, therefore, some form of rehabilitated
experientialism.</p>

<p>In the Hegelian school in the narrower sense the logic of the
master receives some exegesis and defence upon single points
of doctrine rather than as a whole. Its effect upon logic is rather
to be seen in the rethinking of the traditional body of logical
doctrine in the light of an absolute presupposed as ideal, with
the postulate that a regulative ideal must ultimately exhibit
itself as constitutive, the justification of the postulate being held
to lie in the coherence and all-inclusiveness of the result. In such
a logic, if and so far as coherence should be attained, would be
found something akin to the spirit of what Hegel achieves,
though doubtless alien to the letter of what it is his pretension
to have achieved. There is perhaps no serious misrepresentation
involved in regarding a key-thought of this type, though not
necessarily expressed in those verbal forms, as pervading such
logic of the present as coheres with a philosophy of the absolute
conceived from a point of view that is intellectualist throughout.
All other contemporary movements may be said to be in revolt
from Hegel.</p>

<p class="pt1 center">v. <i>Logic from 1880-1910</i></p>

<p>Logic in the present exhibits, though in characteristically
modified shapes, all the main types that have been found in its
past history. There is an intellectualist logic coalescent with an
absolutist metaphysic as aforesaid. There is an epistemological
logic with sometimes formalist, sometimes methodological
leanings. There is a formal-symbolic logic engaged with the
elaboration of a relational calculus. Finally, there is what may be
termed psychological-voluntaryist logic. It is in the rapidity of
development of logical investigations of the third and fourth
types and the growing number of their exponents that the present
shows most clearly the history of logic in the making. All these
movements are logic of the present, and a very brief indication
may be added of points of historical significance.</p>

<p>Of intellectualist logic Francis Herbert Bradley<a name="fa142b" id="fa142b" href="#ft142b"><span class="sp">142</span></a> (b. 1846)
and Bernard Bosanquet<a name="fa143b" id="fa143b" href="#ft143b"><span class="sp">143</span></a> (1848) may be taken as typical exponents.
The philosophy of the former concludes to an Absolute
by the annulment of contradictions, though the ladder of Hegel
is conspicuous by its absence. His metaphysical method, however,
is like Herbart&rsquo;s, not identifiable with his logic, and the
latter has for its central characteristic its thorough restatement
of the logical forms traditional in language and the text-books,
in such a way as to harmonize with the doctrine of a reality
whose organic unity is all-inclusive. The thorough recasting
that this involves, even of the thought of the masters when it
occasionally echoes them, has resulted in a phrasing uncouth to
the ear of the plain man with his world of persons and things
in which the former simply think about the latter, but it is
fundamentally necessary for Bradley&rsquo;s purpose. The negative
judgment, for example, cannot be held in one and the same undivided
act to presuppose the unity of the real, project an adjective
as conceivably applicable to it and assert its rejection.
We need, therefore, a restatement of it. With Bradley reality is
the one subject of all judgment immediate or mediate. The act
of judgment &ldquo;which refers an ideal content (recognized as such)
to a reality beyond the act&rdquo; is the unit for logic. Grammatical
subject and predicate necessarily both fall under the rubric of the
adjectival, that is, within the logical idea or ideal content asserted.
This is a meaning or universal, which can have no detached or
abstract self-subsistence. As found in judgment it may exhibit
differences within itself, but it is not two, but one, an articulation
of unity, not a fusion, which could only be a confusion, of differences.
With a brilliant subtlety Bradley analyses the various
types of judgment in his own way, with results that must be taken
into account by all subsequent logicians of this type. The view
of inference with which he complements it is only less satisfactory
because of a failure to distinguish the principle of nexus in syllogism
from its traditional formulation and rules, and because he
is hampered by the intractability which he finds in certain forms
of relational construction.</p>

<p>Bosanquet had the advantage that his logic was a work of a
slightly later date. He is, perhaps, more able than Bradley has
shown himself, to use material from alien sources and to penetrate
to what is of value in the thought of writers from whom, whether
on the whole or on particular issues, he disagrees. He treats the
book-tradition, however, a debt to which, nowadays inevitable,
he is generous in acknowledging,<a name="fa144b" id="fa144b" href="#ft144b"><span class="sp">144</span></a> with a judicious exercise of
freedom in adaptation, <i>i.e.</i> constructively as datum, never
eclectically. In his fundamental theory of judgment his obligation
is to Bradley. It is to Lotze, however, that he owes most
in the characteristic feature of his logic, viz., the systematic
development of the types of judgment, and inference from less
adequate to more adequate forms. His fundamental continuity
with Bradley may be illustrated by his definition of inference.
&ldquo;Inference is the indirect reference to reality of differences
within a universal, by means of the exhibition of this universal
in differences directly referred to reality.&rdquo;<a name="fa145b" id="fa145b" href="#ft145b"><span class="sp">145</span></a> Bosanquet&rsquo;s <i>Logic</i>
will long retain its place as an authoritative exposition of logic
of this type.</p>

<p>Of epistemological logic in one sense of the phrase Lotze is
still to be regarded as a typical exponent. Of another type
Chr. Sigwart (<i>q.v.</i>) may be named as representative. Sigwart&rsquo;s
aim was &ldquo;to reconstruct logic from the point of view of methodology.&rdquo;
His problem was the claim to arrive at propositions
universally valid, and so true of the object, whosoever the
individual thinker. His solution, within the Kantian circle of
ideas, was that such principles as the Kantian principle of
causality were justified as &ldquo;postulates of the endeavour after
complete knowledge.&rdquo; &ldquo;What Kant has shown is not that
irregular fleeting changes can never be the object of consciousness,
but only that the ideal consciousness of complete science would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page918" id="page918"></a>918</span>
be impossible without the knowledge of the necessity of all
events.&rdquo;<a name="fa146b" id="fa146b" href="#ft146b"><span class="sp">146</span></a> &ldquo;The universal presuppositions which form the outline
of our ideal of knowledge are not so much laws which the
understanding prescribes to nature ... as laws which the
understanding lays down for its own regulation in its investigation
and consideration of nature. They are a priori because no
experience is sufficient to reveal or confirm them in unconditional
universality; but they are a priori ... only in the sense of
presuppositions without which we should work with no hope of
success and merely at random and which therefore we must
believe.&rdquo; Finally they are akin to our ethical principles. With
this coheres his dictum, with its far-reaching consequences for
the philosophy of induction, that &ldquo;the logical justification of
the inductive process rests upon the fact that it is an inevitable
postulate of our effort after knowledge, that the given is necessary,
and can be known as proceeding from its grounds according to
universal laws.&rdquo;<a name="fa147b" id="fa147b" href="#ft147b"><span class="sp">147</span></a> It is characteristic of Sigwart&rsquo;s point of view
that he acknowledges obligation to Mill as well as to Ueberweg.
The transmutation of Mill&rsquo;s induction of inductions into a
postulate is an advance of which the psychological school of
logicians have not been slow to make use. The comparison of
Sigwart with Lotze is instructive, in regard both to their agreement
and their divergence as showing the range of the epistemological
formula.</p>

<p>Of the formal-symbolic logic all that falls to be said here is,
that from the point of view of logic as a whole, it is to be regarded
as a legitimate praxis as long as it shows itself aware of the sense
in which alone form is susceptible of abstraction, and is aware
that in itself it offers no solution of the logical problem. &ldquo;It is
not an algebra,&rdquo; said Kant<a name="fa148b" id="fa148b" href="#ft148b"><span class="sp">148</span></a> of his technical logic, and the kind
of support lent recently to symbolic logic by the <i>Gegenstandstheorie</i>
identified with the name of Alexius Meinong (b. 1853)<a name="fa149b" id="fa149b" href="#ft149b"><span class="sp">149</span></a>
is qualified by the warning that the real activity of thought tends
to fall outside the calculus of relations and to attach rather to the
subsidiary function of denoting. The future of symbolic logic
as coherent with the rest of logic, in the sense which the word has
borne throughout its history seems to be bound up with the
question of the nature of the analysis that lies behind the symbolism,
and of the way in which this is justified in the setting of a
doctrine of validity. The &ldquo;theory of the object,&rdquo; itself, while
affecting logic alike in the formal and in the psychological conception
of it very deeply, does not claim to be regarded as logic
or a logic, apart from a setting supplied from elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finally we have a logic of a type fundamentally psychological,
if it be not more properly characterized as a psychology which
claims to cover the whole field of philosophy, including the logical
field. The central and organizing principle of this is that knowledge
is in genesis, that the genesis takes place in the medium of
individual minds, and that this fact implies that there is a necessary
reference throughout to interests or purposes of the subject
which thinks because it wills and acts. Historically this doctrine
was formulated as the declaration of independence of the insurgents
in revolt against the pretensions of absolutist logic. It
drew for support upon the psychological movement that begins
with Fries and Herbart. It has been chiefly indebted to writers,
who were not, or were not primarily, logicians, to Avenarius, for
example, for the law of the economy of thought, to Wundt, whose
system, and therewith his logic,<a name="fa150b" id="fa150b" href="#ft150b"><span class="sp">150</span></a> is a pendant to his psychology,
for the volitional character of judgment, to Herbert Spencer and
others. A judgment is practical, and not to be divorced without
improper abstraction from the purpose and will that informs it.
A concept is instrumental to an end beyond itself, without any
validity other than its value for action. A situation involving
a need of adaptation to environment arises and the problem it
sets must be solved that the will may control environment and
be justified by success. Truth is the improvised machinery that
is interjected, so far as this works. It is clear that we are in the
presence of what is at least an important half-truth, which
intellectuallism with its statics of the rational order viewed as a
completely articulate system has tended to ignore. It throws
light on many phases of the search for truth, upon the plain man&rsquo;s
claim to start with a subject which he knows whose predicate
which he does not know is still to be developed, or again upon
his use of the negative form of judgment, when the further
determination of his purposive system is served by a positive
judgment from without, the positive content of which is yet to
be dropped as irrelevant to the matter in hand. The movement
has, however, scarcely developed its logic<a name="fa151b" id="fa151b" href="#ft151b"><span class="sp">151</span></a> except as polemic.
What seems clear is that it cannot be the whole solution. While
man must confront nature from the human and largely the
practical standpoint, yet his control is achieved only by the
increasing recognition of objective controls. He conquers by
obedience. So truth works and is economical because it is
truth. Working is proportioned to inner coherence. It is well
that the view should be developed into all its consequences.
The result will be to limit it, though perhaps also to justify it,
save in its claim to reign alone.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, an increasing tendency to recognize that the
organism of knowledge is a thing which from any single viewpoint
must be seen in perspective. It is of course a postulate
that all truths harmonize, but to give the harmonious whole in a
projection in one plane is an undertaking whose adequacy in
one sense involves an inadequacy in another. No human architect
can hope to take up in succession all essential points of view
in regard to the form of knowledge or to logic. &ldquo;The great
campanile is still to finish.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;Historical: No complete history of logic in the
sense in which it is to be distinguished from theoretical philosophy
in general has as yet been written. The history of logic is indeed
so little intelligible apart from constant reference to tendencies in
philosophical development as a whole, that the historian, when he
has made the requisite preparatory studies, inclines to essay the
more ambitious task. Yet there are, of course, works devoted to
the history of logic proper.</p>

<p>Of these Prantl&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte der Logik im Abendlande</i> (4 vols.,
1855-1870), which traces the rise, development and fortunes of the
Aristotelian logic to the close of the middle ages, is monumental.
Next in importance are the works of L. Rabus, <i>Logik und Metaphysik</i>,
i. (1868) (pp. 123-242 historical, pp. 453-518 bibliographical, pp. 514
sqq. a section on apparatus for the study of the history of logic),
<i>Die neuesten Bestrebungen auf dem Gebiete der Logik bei den Deutschen</i>
(1880), <i>Logik</i> (1895), especially for later writers § 17. Ueberweg&rsquo;s
<i>System der Logik und Geschichte der logischen Lehren</i> (4th ed. and last
revised by the author, 1874, though it has been reissued later,
Eng. trans., 1871) is alone to be named with these. Harms&rsquo; posthumously
published <i>Geschichte der Logik</i> (1881) (<i>Die Philosophie in
ihrer Geschichte</i>, ii.) was completed by the author only so far as
Leibnitz. Blakey&rsquo;s <i>Historical Sketch of Logic</i> (1851), though, like all
this writer&rsquo;s works, closing with a bibliography of some pretensions,
is now negligible. Franck, <i>Esquisse d&rsquo;une histoire de la logique</i> (1838)
is the chief French contribution to the subject as a whole.</p>

<p>Of contributions towards the history of special periods or schools
of logical thought the list, from the opening chapters of Ramus&rsquo;s
<i>Scholae Dialecticae</i> (1569) downwards (v. Rabus <i>loc. cit.</i>) would be
endless. What is of value in the earlier works has now been absorbed.
The <i>System der Logik</i> (1828) of Bachmann (a Kantian
logician of distinction) contains a historical survey (pp. 569-644),
as does the <i>Denklehre</i> (1822) of van Calker (allied in thought to
Fries) pp. 12 sqq.; Eberstein&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte der Logik und Metaphysik
bei den Deutschen von Leibniz bis auf gegenwärtige Zeit</i> (latest edition,
1799) is still of importance in regard to logicians of the school of
Wolff and the origines of Kant&rsquo;s logical thought. Hoffmann, the
editor and disciple of von Baader, published <i>Grundzüge einer Geschichte
der Begriffe der Logik in Deutschland von Kant bis Baader</i>
(1851). Wallace&rsquo;s prolegomena and notes to his <i>Logic of Hegel</i>
(1874, revised and augmented 1892-1894) are of use for the history
and terminology, as well as the theory. Riehl&rsquo;s article entitled
<i>Logik in Die Kultur der Gegenwart</i>, vi. 1. <i>Systematische Philosophie</i>
(1907), is excellent, and touches on quite modern developments.
Liard, <i>Les Logiciens Anglais Contemporains</i> (5th ed., 1907), deals
only with the 19th-century inductive and formal-symbolic logicians
down to Jevons, to whom the book was originally dedicated. Venn&rsquo;s
<i>Symbolic Logic</i> (1881) gave a careful history and bibliography of
that development. The history of the more recent changes is as
yet to be found only in the form of unshaped material in the pages
of review and <i>Jahresbericht</i>.</p>

<p><a name="ft21b" id="ft21b" href="#fa21b"><span class="fn">21</span></a> For Plato&rsquo;s Logic, the controversies as to the genuineness of
the dialogues may be treated summarily. The <i>Theaetetus</i> labours
under no suspicion. The <i>Sophistes</i> is apparently matter for animadversion
by Aristotle in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and elsewhere, but derives
stronger support from the testimonies to the <i>Politicus</i> which presumes
it. The <i>Politicus</i> and <i>Philebus</i> are guaranteed by the use
made of them in Aristotle&rsquo;s Ethics. The rejection of the <i>Parmenides</i>
would involve the paradox of a nameless contemporary of Plato
and Aristotle who was inferior as a metaphysician to neither. No
other dialogue adds anything to the <i>logical</i> content of these.</p>

<p>Granted their genuineness, the relative dating of three of them is
given, viz. <i>Theaetetus</i>, <i>Sophistes</i> and <i>Politicus</i> in the order named.
The <i>Philebus</i> seems to presuppose <i>Politicus</i>, 283-284, but if this be
an error, it will affect the logical theory not at all. There remains
the <i>Parmenides</i>. It can scarcely be later than the <i>Sophistes</i>. The
antinomies with which it concludes are more naturally taken as a
prelude to the discussion of the <i>Sophistes</i> than as an unnecessary
retreatment of the doctrine of the one and the many in a more
negative form. It may well be earlier than the <i>Theaetetus</i> in its
present form. The stylistic argument shows the <i>Theaetetus</i> relatively
early. The maturity of its philosophic outlook tends to
give it a place relatively advanced in the Platonic canon. To meet
the problem here raised, the theory has been devised of an earlier
and a later version. The first may have linked on to the series of
Plato&rsquo;s dialogues of search, and to put the <i>Parmenides</i> before it is
impossible. The second, though it might still have preceded the
<i>Parmenides</i> might equally well have followed the negative criticism
of that dialogue, as the beginning of reconstruction. For Plato&rsquo;s
logic this question only has interest on account of the introduction
of an <span class="grk" title="Aristotelês">&#7944;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#962;</span> in a non-speaking part in the <i>Parmenides</i>. If
this be pressed as suggesting that the philosopher Aristotle was
already in full activity at the date of writing, it is of importance to
know what Platonic dialogues were later than the début of his
critical pupil.</p>

<p>On the stylistic argument as applied to Platonic controversies
Janell&rsquo;s <i>Quaestiones Platonicae</i> (1901) is important. On the whole
question of genuineness and dates of the dialogues, H. Raeder,
<i>Platons philosophische Entwickelung</i> (1905), gives an excellent
conspectus of the views held and the grounds alleged. See also

(2 vols., 1844-1846). Among the innumerable writers who have
thrown light upon Aristotle&rsquo;s logical doctrine, St Hilaire, Trendelenburg,
Ueberweg, Hamilton, Mansel, G. Grote may be named. There
are, however, others of equal distinction. Reference to Prantl,
op. cit., is indispensable. Zeller, <i>Die philosophie der Griechen</i>, ii. 2,
&ldquo;Aristoteles&rdquo; (3rd ed., 1879), pp. 185-257 (there is an Eng. trans.),
and Maier, <i>Die Syllogistik des Aristoteles</i> (2 vols., 1896, 1900) (some

<p><a name="ft131b" id="ft131b" href="#fa131b"><span class="fn">131</span></a> Or antitheses. Kant follows, for example, a different line of
cleavage between form and content from that developed between
thought and the &ldquo;given.&rdquo; And these are not his only unresolved
dualities, even in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. For the logical
inquiry, however, it is permissible to ignore or reduce these differences.</p>

<p>The determination too of the sense in which Kant&rsquo;s theory of
knowledge involves an unresolved antithesis is for the logical purpose
necessary so far only as it throws light upon his logic and his influence
upon logical developments. Historically the question of
the extent to which writers adopted the dualistic interpretation or
one that had the like consequences is of greater importance.</p>

<p>It may be said summarily that Kant holds the antithesis between
thought and &ldquo;the given&rdquo; to be unresolved and within the limits
of theory of knowledge irreducible. The dove of thought falls lifeless
if the resistant atmosphere of &ldquo;the given&rdquo; be withdrawn (<i>Critique
of Pure Reason</i>, ed. 2 Introd. Kant&rsquo;s <i>Werke</i>, ed. of the Prussian
Academy, vol. iii. p. 32, ll. 10 sqq.). Nevertheless the thing-in-itself
is a problematic conception and of a limiting or negative use
merely. He &ldquo;had woven,&rdquo; according to an often quoted phrase
of Goethe, &ldquo;a certain sly element of irony into his method; ... he
pointed as it were with a side gesture beyond the limits which he
himself had drawn.&rdquo; Thus (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 46, ll. 8, 9) he declares that
&ldquo;there are two lineages united in human knowledge, which perhaps
spring from a common stock, though to us unknown&mdash;namely sense
and understanding.&rdquo; Some indication of the way in which he
would hypothetically and speculatively mitigate the antithesis is
perhaps afforded by the reflection that the distinction of the mental
and what appears as material is an external distinction in which
the one appears outside to the other. &ldquo;Yet what as thing-in-itself
lies back of the phenomenon may perhaps not be so wholly disparate
after all&rdquo; (ib. p. 278, ll. 26 sqq.).</p>

Their representatives, with one exception, came from
Ionia and its islands, which from their position were most favourably
situated for the acquisition of knowledge concerning the
distant countries of East and West. They wrote in the Ionic
dialect, in what was called the unperiodic style, and preserved
the poetic character of their epic model. Their criticism amounts
to nothing more than a crude attempt to rationalize the current
legends and traditions connected with the founding of cities,
the genealogies of ruling families, and the manners and customs
of individual peoples. Of scientific criticism there is no trace
whatever. The first of these historians was probably Cadmus
of Miletus (who lived, if at all, in the early part of the 6th century),
the earliest writer of prose, author of a work on the founding
of his native city and the colonization of Ionia (so Suïdas);
Pherecydes of Leros, who died about 400, is generally considered
the last. Mention may also be made of the following: Hecataeus
of Miletus (550-476); Acusilaus of Argos,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> who paraphrased
in prose (correcting the tradition where it seemed necessary)
the genealogical works of Hesiod in the Ionic dialect; he confined
his attention to the prehistoric period, and made no attempt
at a real history; Charon of Lampsacus (<i>c.</i> 450), author of
histories of Persia, Libya, and Ethiopia, of annals (<span class="grk" title="hôroi">&#8038;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>) of
his native town with lists of the prytaneis and archons, and of
the chronicles of Lacedaemonian kings; Xanthus of Sardis in
Lydia (<i>c.</i> 450), author of a history of Lydia, one of the chief
authorities used by Nicolaus of Damascus (<i>fl.</i> during the time of
Augustus); Hellanicus of Mytilene; Stesimbrotus of Thasos,
opponent of Pericles and reputed author of a political pamphlet
on Themistocles, Thucydides and Pericles; Hippys and Glaucus,
both of Rhegium, the first the author of histories of Italy and
Sicily, the second of a treatise on ancient poets and musicians,
used by Harpocration and Plutarch; Damastes of Sigeum,

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LOGOS<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>, a common term in ancient philosophy and
theology. It expresses the idea of an immanent reason in the
world, and, under various modifications, is met with in Indian,
Egyptian and Persian systems of thought. But the idea was
developed mainly in Hellenic and Hebrew philosophy, and we
may distinguish the following stages:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Hellenic Logos.</i>&mdash;To the Greek mind, which saw in
the world a <span class="grk" title="kosmos">&#954;&#972;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span> (ordered whole), it was natural to regard the
world as the product of reason, and reason as the ruling principle
in the world. So we find a Logos doctrine more or less prominent
from the dawn of Hellenic thought to its eclipse. It rises in
the realm of physical speculation, passes over into the territory
of ethics and theology, and makes its way through at least
three well-defined stages. These are marked off by the names
of Heraclitus of Ephesus, the Stoics and Philo.</p>

<p>It acquires its first importance in the theories of Heraclitus
(6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), who, trying to account for the aesthetic
order of the visible universe, broke away to some extent from
the purely physical conceptions of his predecessors and discerned
at work in the cosmic process a <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> analogous to the reasoning
power in man. On the one hand the Logos is identified with
<span class="grk" title="gnômê">&#947;&#957;&#974;&#956;&#951;</span> and connected with <span class="grk" title="dikê">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;</span>, which latter seems to have the
function of correcting deviations from the eternal law that rules
in things. On the other hand it is not positively distinguished
either from the ethereal fire, or from the <span class="grk" title="heimarmenê">&#949;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span> and the <span class="grk" title="anankê">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#947;&#954;&#951;</span>
according to which all things occur. Heraclitus holds that nothing
material can be thought of without this Logos, but he does not
conceive the Logos itself to be immaterial. Whether it is regarded
as in any sense possessed of intelligence and consciousness is
a question variously answered. But there is most to say for
the negative. This Logos is not one above the world or prior
to it, but in the world and inseparable from it. Man&rsquo;s soul is a
part of it. It is <i>relation</i>, therefore, as Schleiermacher expresses
it, or reason, not speech or word. And it is objective, not subjective,
reason. Like a law of nature, objective in the world,
it gives order and regularity to the movement of things, and
makes the system rational.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The failure of Heraclitus to free himself entirely from the
physical hypotheses of earlier times prevented his speculation
from influencing his successors. With Anaxagoras a conception
entered which gradually triumphed over that of Heraclitus,
namely, the conception of a supreme, intellectual principle,
not identified with the world but independent of it. This,
however, was <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, not Logos. In the Platonic and Aristotelian
systems, too, the theory of ideas involved an absolute separation
between the material world and the world of higher reality,
and though the term Logos is found the conception is vague
and undeveloped. With Plato the term selected for the expression
of the principle to which the order visible in the universe is
due is <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> or <span class="grk" title="sophia">&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>, not <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>. It is in the pseudo-Platonic
<i>Epinomis</i> that <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> appears as a synonym for <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>. In Aristotle,
again, the principle which sets all nature under the rule of thought,
and directs it towards a rational end, is <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, or the divine
spirit itself; while <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> is a term with many senses, used as
more or less identical with a number of phrases, <span class="grk" title="ou heneka">&#959;&#8022; &#7957;&#957;&#949;&#954;&#945;</span>,
<span class="grk" title="energeia">&#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span>, <span class="grk" title="entelecheia">&#7952;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>, <span class="grk" title="ousia">&#959;&#8016;&#963;&#943;&#945;</span>, <span class="grk" title="eidos">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="morphê">&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#942;</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the reaction from Platonic dualism, however, the Logos
doctrine reappears in great breadth. It is a capital element in
the system of the Stoics. With their teleological views of the
world they naturally predicated an active principle pervading
it and determining it. This operative principle is called both
Logos and God. It is conceived of as material, and is described
in terms used equally of nature and of God. There is at the same
time the special doctrine of the <span class="grk" title="logos spermatikos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, the seminal
Logos, or the law of generation in the world, the principle of the
active reason working in dead matter. This parts into <span class="grk" title="logoi
spermatikoi">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#943;</span>, which are akin, not to the Platonic ideas, but
rather to the <span class="grk" title="logoi enuloi">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#953; &#7956;&#957;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> of Aristotle. In man, too, there is
a Logos which is his characteristic possession, and which is
<span class="grk" title="endiathetos">&#7952;&#957;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, as long as it is a thought resident within his breast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page920" id="page920"></a>920</span>
but <span class="grk" title="prophorikos">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span> when it is expressed as a word. This distinction
between Logos as ratio and Logos as <i>oratio</i>, so much used subsequently
by Philo and the Christian fathers, had been so far
anticipated by Aristotle&rsquo;s distinction between the <span class="grk" title="exô logos">&#7956;&#958;&#969; &#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> and
the <span class="grk" title="logos en tê psychê">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8135;</span>. It forms the point of attachment by which
the Logos doctrine connected itself with Christianity. The Logos
of the Stoics (<i>q.v.</i>) is a reason in the world gifted with intelligence,
and analogous to the reason in man.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Hebrew Logos.</i>&mdash;In the later Judaism the earlier
anthropomorphic conception of God and with it the sense of
the divine nearness had been succeeded by a belief which placed
God at a remote distance, severed from man and the world by
a deep chasm. The old familiar name Yahweh became a secret;
its place was taken by such general expressions as the Holy, the
Almighty, the Majesty on High, the King of Kings, and also
by the simple word &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo; Instead of the once powerful
confidence in the immediate presence of God there grew up a
mass of speculation regarding on the one hand the distant future,
on the other the distant past. Various attempts were made to
bridge the gulf between God and man, including the angels, and
a number of other hybrid forms of which it is hard to say whether
they are personal beings or abstractions. The wisdom, the
Shekinah or Glory, and the Spirit of God are intermediate
beings of this kind, and even the Law came to be regarded as an
independent spiritual entity. Among these conceptions that
of the word of God had an important place, especially the
creative word of Genesis i. Here as in the other cases we cannot
always say whether the Word is regarded as a mere attribute or
activity of God, or an independent being, though there is a clear
tendency towards the latter. The ambiguity lies in the twofold
purpose of these activities: (1) to establish communication with
God; (2) to prevent direct connexion between God and the world.
The word of the God of revelation is represented as the creative
principle (<i>e.g.</i> Gen. i. 3; Psalm xxxiii. 6), as the executor of the
divine judgments (Hosea vi. 5), as healing (Psalm cvii. 20), as
possessed of almost personal qualities (Isaiah lv. 11; Psalm
cxlvii. 15). Along with this comes the doctrine of the angel of
Yahweh, the angel of the covenant, the angel of the presence, in
whom God manifests Himself, and who is sometimes identified
with Yahweh or Elohim (Gen. xvi. 11, 13; xxxii. 29-31; Exod.
iii. 2; xiii. 21), sometimes distinguished from Him (Gen. xxii.
15, &amp;c.; xxiv. 7; xxviii. 12, &amp;c.), and sometimes presented
in both aspects (Judges ii., vi.; Zech. i.). To this must be
added the doctrine of Wisdom, given in the books of Job and
Proverbs. At one time it is exhibited as an attribute of God
(Prov. iii. 19). At another it is strongly personified, so as to
become rather the creative thought of God than a quality (Prov.
viii. 22). Again it is described as proceeding from God as the
principle of creation and objective to Him. In these and
kindred passages (Job xv. 7, &amp;c.) it is on the way to become
hypostatized.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Hebrew conception is partially associated with the Greek in
the case of Aristobulus, the predecessor of Philo, and, according
to the fathers, the founder of the Alexandrian school. He speaks of
Wisdom in a way reminding us of the book of Proverbs. The
pseudo-Solomonic <i>Book of Wisdom</i> (generally supposed to be the
work of an Alexandrian flourishing somewhere between Aristobulus
and Philo) deals both with the Wisdom and with the Logos. It
fails to hypostatize either. But it represents the former as the
framer of the world, as the power or spirit of God, active alike in
the physical, the intellectual, and the ethical domain, and apparently
objective to God. In the Targums, on the other hand, the three
doctrines of the word, the angel, and the wisdom of God converge
in a very definite conception. In the Jewish theology God is represented
as purely transcendent, having no likeness of nature with
man, and making no personal entrance into history. Instead of
the immediate relation of God to the world the Targums introduce
the ideas of the <i>M&#275;mr&#257;</i> (word) and the <i>Shech&#299;n&#257;</i> (real presence).
This Memra (= Ma&rsquo;amar) or, as it is also designated, <i>Dibb&#363;r&#257;</i>, is a
hypostasis that takes the place of God when direct intercourse with
man is in view. In all those passages of the Old Testament where
anthropomorphic terms are used of God, the Memra is substituted
for God. The Memra proceeds from God, and retains the creaturely
relation to God. It does not seem to have been identified with the
Messiah.<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>
</div>

<p>3. <i>Philo.</i>&mdash;In the Alexandrian philosophy, as represented by
the Hellenized Jew Philo, the Logos doctrine assumes a leading
place and shapes a new career for itself. Philo&rsquo;s doctrine is
moulded by three forces&mdash;Platonism, Stoicism and Hebraism.
He detaches the Logos idea from its connexion with Stoic
materialism and attaches it to a thoroughgoing Platonism.
It is Plato&rsquo;s idea of the Good regarded as creatively active.
Hence, instead of being merely immanent in the Cosmos, it has
an independent existence. Platonic too is the doctrine of the
divine architect who seeks to realize in the visible universe
the archetypes already formed in his mind. Philo was thus
able to make the Logos theory a bridge between Judaism and
Greek philosophy. It preserved the monotheistic idea yet
afforded a description of the Divine activity in terms of Hellenic
thought; the word of the Old Testament is one with the <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>
of the Stoics. And thus in Philo&rsquo;s conception the Logos is much
more than &ldquo;the principle of reason, informing the infinite
variety of things, and so creating the World-Order&rdquo;; it is also
the divine dynamic, the energy and self-revelation of God.
The Stoics indeed sought, more or less consciously, by their
doctrine of the Logos as the Infinite Reason to escape from
the belief in a divine Creator, but Philo, Jew to the core, starts
from the Jewish belief in a supreme, self-existing God, to whom
the reason of the world must be subordinated though related.
The conflict of the two conceptions (the Greek and the Hebrew)
led him into some difficulty; sometimes he represents the Logos
as an independent and even personal being, a &ldquo;second God,&rdquo;
sometimes as merely an aspect of the divine activity. And
though passages of the first class must no doubt be explained
figuratively&mdash;for Philo would not assert the existence of two
Divine agents&mdash;it remains true that the two conceptions cannot
be fused. The Alexandrian philosopher wavers between the
two theories and has to accord to the Logos of Hellas a semi-independent
position beside the supreme God of Judaea. He
speaks of the Logos (1) as the agency by which God reveals
Himself, in some measure to all men, in greater degree to chosen
souls. The appearances recorded in the Old Testament are
manifestations of the Logos, and the knowledge of God possessed
by the great leaders and teachers of Israel is due to the same
source; (2) as the agency whereby man, enmeshed by illusion,
lays hold of the higher spiritual life and rising above his partial
point of view participates in the universal reason. The Logos is
thus the means of redemption; those who realize its activity
being emancipated from the tyranny of circumstance into the
freedom of the eternal.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Fourth Gospel.</i>&mdash;Among the influences that shaped
the Fourth Gospel that of the Alexandrian philosophy must be
assigned a distinct, though not an exaggerated importance.
There are other books in the New Testament that bear the same
impress, the epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians, and to
a much greater degree the epistle to the Hebrews. The development
that had thus begun in the time of Paul reaches maturity
in the Fourth Gospel, whose dependence on Philo appears (1)
in the use of the allegorical method, (2) in many coincident
passages, (3) in the dominant conception of the Logos. The
writer narrates the life of Christ from the point of view furnished
him by Philo&rsquo;s theory. True, the Logos doctrine is only mentioned
in the prologue to the Gospel, but it is presupposed
throughout the whole book. The author&rsquo;s task indeed was
somewhat akin to that of Philo, &ldquo;to transplant into the world of
Hellenic culture a revelation originally given through Judaism.&rdquo;
This is not to say that he holds the Logos doctrine in exactly
the same form as Philo. On the contrary, the fact that he
starts from an actual knowledge of the earthly life of Jesus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page921" id="page921"></a>921</span>
while Philo, even when ascribing a real personality to the Logos,
keeps within the bounds of abstract speculation, leads him
seriously to modify the Philonic doctrine. Though the Alexandrian
idea largely determines the evangelist&rsquo;s treatment of
the history, the history similarly reacts on the idea. The prologue
is an organic portion of the Gospel and not a preface
written to conciliate a philosophic public. It assumes that the
Logos idea is familiar in Christian theology, and vividly summarizes
the main features of the Philonic conception&mdash;the
eternal existence of the Logos, its relation to God (<span class="grk" title="pros ton theon">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</span>,
yet distinct), its creative, illuminative and redemptive activity.
But the adaptation of the idea to John&rsquo;s account of a historical
person involved at least three profound modifications:&mdash;(1)
the Logos, instead of the abstraction or semi-personification
of Philo, becomes fully personified. The word that became
flesh subsisted from all eternity as a distinct personality within
the divine nature. (2) Much greater stress is laid upon the
redemptive than upon the creative function. The latter indeed
is glanced at (&ldquo;All things were made by him&rdquo;), merely to provide
a link with earlier speculation, but what the writer is
concerned about is not the mode in which the world came into
being but the spiritual life which resides in the Logos and is
communicated by him to men. (3) The idea of <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> as Reason
becomes subordinated to the idea of <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> as Word, the expression
of God&rsquo;s will and power, the outgoing of the divine energy, life,
love and light. Thus in its fundamental thought the prologue
of the Fourth Gospel comes nearer to the Old Testament (and
especially to Gen. i.) than to Philo. As speech goes out from
a man and reveals his character and thought, so Christ is &ldquo;sent
out from the Father,&rdquo; and as the divine word is also, in accordance
with the Hebrew idea, the medium of God&rsquo;s quickening
power.</p>

<p>What John thus does is to take the Logos idea of Philo and
use it for a practical purpose&mdash;to make more intelligible to himself
and his readers the divine nature of Jesus Christ. That this
endeavour to work into the historical tradition of the life and
teaching of Jesus&mdash;a hypothesis which had a distinctly foreign
origin&mdash;led him into serious difficulties is a consideration that
must be discussed elsewhere.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>5. <i>The Early Church.</i>&mdash;In many of the early Christian writers,
as well as in the heterodox schools, the Logos doctrine is influenced
by the Greek idea. The Syrian Gnostic Basilides held (according
to Irenaeus i. 24) that the Logos or Word emanated from the <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>,
or personified reason, as this latter emanated from the unbegotten
Father. The completest type of Gnosticism, the Valentinian, regarded
Wisdom as the last of the series of aeons that emanated from
the original Being or Father, and the Logos as an emanation from
the first two principles that issued from God, Reason (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>) and Truth.
Justin Martyr, the first of the sub-apostolic fathers, taught that
God produced of His own nature a rational power(<span class="grk" title="dynamin tina logikên">&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#943;&#957; &#964;&#953;&#957;&#945; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#957;</span>),
His agent in creation, who now became man in Jesus (<i>Dial. c. Tryph.</i>
chap. 48, 60). He affirmed also the action of the <span class="grk" title="logos spermatikos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>,
(<i>Apol.</i> i. 46; ii. 13, &amp;c.). With Tatian (<i>Cohort. ad. Gr.</i> chap. 5, &amp;c.)
the Logos is the beginning of the world, the reason that comes into
being as the sharer of God&rsquo;s rational power. With Athenagoras
(<i>Suppl.</i> chap. 9, 10) He is the prototype of the world and the
energizing principle (<span class="grk" title="idea kai energeia">&#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>) of things. Theophilus (Ad
<i>Autolyc.</i> ii. 10, 24) taught that the Logos was in eternity with
God as the <span class="grk" title="logos endiathetos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#957;&#948;&#953;&#940;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, the counsellor of God, and that when
the world was to be created God sent forth this counsellor (<span class="grk" title="symboulos">&#963;&#973;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>)
from Himself as the <span class="grk" title="logos prophorikos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962;</span>, yet so that the begotten
Logos did not cease to be a part of Himself. With Hippolytus
(<i>Refut.</i> x. 32, &amp;c.) the Logos, produced of God&rsquo;s own substance, is
both the divine intelligence that appears in the world as the Son
of God, and the idea of the universe immanent in God. The early
Sabellians (comp. Eusebius, <i>Hist. Eccl.</i> vi. 33; Athanasius, <i>Contra
Arian.</i> iv.) held that the Logos was a faculty of God, the divine
reason, immanent in God eternally, but not in distinct personality
prior to the historical manifestation in Christ. Origen, referring
the act of creation to eternity instead of to time, affirmed the eternal
personal existence of the Logos. In relation to God this Logos or
Son was a copy of the original, and as such inferior to that. In
relation to the world he was its prototype, the <span class="grk" title="idea ideôn">&#7984;&#948;&#941;&#945; &#7984;&#948;&#949;&#8182;&#957;</span> and its
redeeming power (<i>Contra Cels.</i> v. 608; <i>Frag. de princip.</i> i. 4;
<i>De princip.</i> i. 109, 324).</p>

<p>In the later developments of Hellenic speculation nothing essential
was added to the doctrine of the Logos. Philo&rsquo;s distinction between
God and His rational power or Logos in contact with the world was
generally maintained by the eclectic Platonists and Neo-Platonists.
By some of these this distinction was carried out to the extent of
predicating (as was done by Numenius of Apamea) three Gods:&mdash;the
supreme God; the second God, or Demiurge or Logos; and the
third God, or the world. Plotinus explained the logoi as constructive
forces, proceeding from the ideas and giving form to the dead
matter of sensible things (<i>Enneads</i>, v. 1. 8 and Richter&rsquo;s <i>Neu-Plat.
Studien</i>).</p>

borrowed by the west, though it only became firmly established
in Sicily, where the <i>logotheta</i> occupied the position of chancellor
elsewhere, his office being equal if not superior to that of the

<p><span class="bold">LOGROÑO,<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> an inland province of northern Spain, the smallest
of the eight provinces formed in 1833 out of Old Castile; bounded
N. by Burgos, Álava and Navarre, W. by Burgos, S. by Soria and
E. by Navarre and Saragossa. Pop. (1900) 189,376; area,
1946 sq. m. Logroño belongs entirely to the basin of the river
Ebro, which forms its northern boundary except for a short
distance near San Vicente; it is drained chiefly by the rivers
Tiron, Oja, Najerilla, Iregua, Leza, Cidacos and Alhama, all
flowing in a north-easterly direction. The portion skirting the
Ebro forms a spacious and for the most part fertile undulating
plain, called La Rioja, but in the south Logroño is considerably
broken up by offshoots from the sierras which separate that
river from the Douro. In the west the Cerro de San Lorenzo,
the culminating point of the Sierra de la Demanda, rises 7562 ft.,
and in the south the Pico de Urbion reaches 7388 ft. The products
of the province are chiefly cereals, good oil and wine
(especially in the Rioja), fruit, silk, flax and honey. Wine is the
principal export, although after 1892 this industry suffered
greatly from the protective duties imposed by France. Great
efforts have been made to keep a hold upon French and English
markets with light red and white Rioja wines. No less than
128,000 acres are covered with vines, and 21,000 with olive
groves. Iron and argentiferous lead are mined in small quantities
and other ores have been discovered. The manufacturing
industries are insignificant. A railway along the right bank of
the Ebro connects the province with Saragossa, and from
Miranda there is railway communication with Madrid, Bilbao
and France; but there is no railway in the southern districts,
where trade is much retarded by the lack even of good roads.
The town of Logroño (pop. 1900, 19,237) and the city of Calahorra
(9475) are separately described. The only other towns
with upwards of 5000 inhabitants are Haro (7914), Alfaro (5938)
and Cervera del Río Alhama (5930).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOGROÑO,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> the capital of the Spanish province of Logroño,
on the right bank of the river Ebro and on the Saragossa-Miranda
de Ebro railway. Pop. (1900) 19,237. Logroño is an
ancient walled town, finely situated on a hill 1204 ft. high.
Its bridge of twelve arches across the Ebro was built in 1138,
but has frequently been restored after partial destruction by
floods. The main street, arcaded on both sides, and the crooked
but highly picturesque alleys of the older quarters are in striking
contrast with the broad, tree-shaded avenues and squares laid
out in modern times. The chief buildings are a bull-ring which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page922" id="page922"></a>922</span>
accommodates 11,000 spectators, and a church, Santa Maria de
Palacio, called &ldquo;the imperial,&rdquo; from the tradition that its founder
was Constantine the Great (274-337). As the commercial centre
of the fertile and well-cultivated plain of the Rioja, Logroño
has an important trade in wine.</p>

<p>The district of Logroño was in ancient times inhabited by
the <i>Berones</i> or <i>Verones</i> of Strabo and Pliny, and their <i>Varia</i> is
to be identified with the modern suburb of the city of Logroño
now known as Varea of Barea. Logroño was named by the
Romans <i>Juliobriga</i> and afterwards <i>Lucronius</i>. It fell into the
hands of the Moors in the 8th century, but was speedily retaken
by the Christians, and under the name of Lucronius appears
with frequency in medieval history. It was unsuccessfully
besieged by the French in 1521, and occupied by them from
1808 to 1813. It was the birthplace of the dumb painter Juan
Fernandez Navarrete (1526-1579).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOGROSCINO<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Lo Groscino</span>), <span class="bold">NICOLA</span> (1700?-1763?),
Italian musical composer, was born at Naples and was a pupil
of Durante. In 1738 he collaborated with Leo and others in the
hasty production of <i>Demetrio</i>; in the autumn of the same year
he produced a comic opera <i>L&rsquo;inganno per inganno</i>, the first of a
long series of comic operas, the success of which won him the
name of &ldquo;il Dio dell&rsquo; opera buffa.&rdquo; He went to Palermo, probably
in 1747, as a teacher of counterpoint; as an opera composer
he is last heard of in 1760, and is supposed to have died about
1763. Logroscino has been credited with the invention of the
concerted operatic finale, but as far as can be seen from the
score of <i>Il Governatore</i> and the few remaining fragments of
other operas, his finales show no advance upon those of Leo.
As a musical humorist, however, he deserves remembrance, and
may justly be classed alongside of Rossini.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOGWOOD<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (so called from the form in which it is imported),
the heart-wood of a leguminous tree, <i>Haematoxylon campechianum</i>,
native of Central America, and grown also in the West
Indian Islands. The tree attains a height not exceeding 40 ft.,
and is said to be ready for felling when about ten years old.
The wood, deprived of its bark and the sap-wood, is sent into
the market in the form of large blocks and billets. It is very
hard and dense, and externally has a dark brownish-red colour;
but it is less deeply coloured within. The best qualities come
from Campeachy, but it is obtained there only in small quantity.</p>

<p>Logwood is used in dyeing (<i>q.v.</i>), in microscopy, in the preparation
of ink, and to a small extent in medicine on account of the
tannic acid it contains, though it has no special medicinal value,
being much inferior to kino and catechu. The wood was introduced
into Europe as a dyeing substance soon after the discovery
of America, but from 1581 to 1662 its use in England was prohibited
by legislative enactment on account of the inferior dyes
which at first were produced by its employment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The colouring principle of logwood exists in the timber in the form
of a glucoside, from which it is liberated as haematoxylin by fermentation.
Haematoxylin, C<span class="su">16</span>H<span class="su">14</span>O<span class="su">6</span>, was isolated by M. E. Chevreul
in 1810. It forms a crystalline hydrate, C<span class="su">16</span>H<span class="su">14</span>O<span class="su">6</span> + 3H<span class="su">2</span>O, which is
a colourless body very sparingly soluble in cold water, but dissolving
freely in hot water and in alcohol. By exposure to the air, especially
in alkaline solutions, haematoxylin is rapidly oxidized into haematein,
C<span class="su">16</span>H<span class="su">12</span>O<span class="su">6</span>, with the development of a fine purple colour. This reaction
of haematoxylin is exceedingly rapid and delicate, rendering
that body a laboratory test for alkalis. By the action of hydrogen
and sulphurous acid, haematein is easily reduced to haematoxylin.
It is chemically related to brazilin, found in brazil-wood. Haematoxylin
and brazilin, and also their oxidation products, haematin
and brazilin, have been elucidated by W. H. Perkin and his pupils
(see <i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1908, 1909).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÖHE, JOHANN KONRAD WILHELM<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> ( 1808-1872), German
divine and philanthropist, was born on the 21st of February
1808 in Fürth near Nuremberg, and was educated at the universities
of Erlangen and Berlin. In 1831 he was appointed vicar
at Kirchenlamitz, where his fervent evangelical preaching
attracted large congregations and puzzled the ecclesiastical
authorities. A similar experience ensued at Nuremberg, where
he was assistant pastor of St Egidia. In 1837 he became pastor
in Neuendettelsau, a small and unattractive place, where his life&rsquo;s
work was done, and which he transformed into a busy and
influential community. He was interested in the spiritual
condition of Germans who had emigrated to the United States,
and built two training homes for missionaries to them. In 1849
he founded the Lutheran Society of Home Missions and in 1853
an institution of deaconesses. Other institutions were added to
these, including a lunatic asylum, a Magdalen refuge, and hospitals
for men and women. In theology Löhe was a strict Lutheran,
but his piety was of a most attractive kind. Originality of
conception, vividness of presentation, fertility of imagination,
wide knowledge of Scripture and a happy faculty of applying
it, intense spiritual fervour, a striking physique and a powerful
voice made him a great pulpit force. He wrote a good deal,
amongst his books being <i>Drei Bücher von der Kirche</i> (1845),
<i>Samenkörner des Gebetes</i> (over 30 editions) and several volumes of
sermons. He died on the 2nd of January 1872.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOHENGRIN,<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> the hero of the German version of the legend
of the knight of the swan. The story of Lohengrin as we know
it is based on two principal motives common enough in folklore:
the metamorphosis of human beings into swans, and the curious
wife whose question brings disaster. Lohengrin&rsquo;s guide (the
swan) was originally the little brother who, in one version of &ldquo;the
Seven Swans,&rdquo; was compelled through the destruction of his
golden chain to remain in swan form and attached himself to
the fortunes of one of his brothers. The swan played a part
in classical mythology as the bird of Apollo, and in Scandinavian
lore the swan maidens, who have the gift of prophecy and are
sometimes confused with the Valkyries, reappear again and
again. The wife&rsquo;s desire to know her husband&rsquo;s origin is a
parallel of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, and bore in medieval
times a similar mystical interpretation. The Lohengrin legend
is localized on the Lower Rhine, and its incidents take place
at Antwerp, Nijmwegen, Cologne and Mainz. In its application
it falls into sharp division in the hands of German and French
poets. By the Germans it was turned to mystical use by being
attached loosely to the Grail legend (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Grail</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Perceval</a></span>);
in France it was adapted to glorify the family of Godfrey de
Bouillon.</p>

<p>The German story makes its appearance in the last stanzas
of Wolfram von Eschenbach&rsquo;s <i>Parzival</i>, where it is related how
Parzival&rsquo;s son, Loherangrîn,<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was sent from the castle of the
Grail to the help of the young duchess of Brabant. Guided
by the swan he reached Antwerp, and married the lady on
condition that she should not ask his origin. On the breach
of this condition years afterwards Loherangrîn departed, leaving
sword, horn and ring behind him. Between 1283 and 1290, a
Bavarian disciple of Wolfram&rsquo;s<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> adopted the story and developed
it into an epic poem of nearly 8000 lines, incorporating episodes
of Lohengrin&rsquo;s prowess in tournament, his wars with Henry I.
against the heathen Hungarians and the Saracens,<a name="fa3e" id="fa3e" href="#ft3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and incidentally
providing a detailed picture of the everyday life of
people of high condition. The epic of Lohengrin is put by the
anonymous writer into the mouth of Wolfram, who is made
to relate it during the Contest of the Singers at the Wartburg
in proof of his superiority in knowledge of sacred things over
Klingsor the magician, and the poem is thus linked on to German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page923" id="page923"></a>923</span>
tradition. Its connexion with Parzival implies a mystic application.
The consecrated wafer shared by Lohengrin and the
swan on their voyage is one of the more obvious means taken
by the poet to give the tale the character of an allegory of the
relations between Christ, the Church and the human soul.
The story was followed closely in its main outlines by Richard
Wagner in his opera <i>Lohengrin</i>.</p>

<p>The French legend of the knight of the swan is attached to
the house of Bouillon, and although William of Tyre refers
to it about 1170 as fable, it was incorporated without question
by later annalists. It forms part of the cycle of the <i>chansons
de geste</i> dealing with the Crusade, and relates how Helyas,
knight of the swan, is guided by the swan to the help of the
duchess of Bouillon and marries her daughter Ida or Beatrix
in circumstances exactly parallel to the adventures of Lohengrin
and Elsa of Brabant, and with the like result. Their daughter
marries Eustache, count of Boulogne, and had three sons, the
eldest of whom, Godefroid (Godfrey), is the future king of
Jerusalem. But in French story Helyas is not the son of Parzival,
but of the king and queen of Lillefort, and the story of his birth,
of himself, his five brothers and one sister is, with variations,
that of &ldquo;the seven swans&rdquo; persecuted by the wicked grandmother,
which figures in the pages of Grimm and Hans Andersen.
The house of Bouillon was not alone in claiming the knight
of the swan as an ancestor, and the tradition probably originally
belonged to the house of Cleves.</p>

<i>lumbus</i>), that part of the body in an animal which lies between
the upper part of the hip-bone and the last of the false ribs on
either side of the back-bone, hence in the plural the general
term for the lower part of the human body at the junction
with the legs, covered by the loin-cloth, the almost universal
garment among primitive peoples. There are also figurative
uses of the word, chiefly biblical, due to the loins being the
supposed seat of male vigour and power of generation. Apart
from these uses the word is a butcher&rsquo;s term for a joint
of meat cut from this part of the body. The upper part of a
loin of beef is known as the &ldquo;surloin&rdquo; (Fr. <i>surlonge</i>, <i>i.e.</i> upper

a legend invented, to account for the name, of a king, James I.

<p><span class="bold">LOIRE,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> the longest river of France, rising in the Gerbier de
Jonc in the department of Ardèche, at a height of 4500 ft.
and flowing north and west to the Atlantic. After a course
of 18 m. in Ardèche it enters Haute-Loire, in which it follows
a picturesque channel along the foot of basaltic rocks, through
narrow gorges and small plains. At Vorey, where it is joined
by the Arzon, it becomes navigable for rafts. Four miles below
its entrance into the department of Loire, at La Noirie, river
navigation is officially reckoned to begin, and breaking through
the gorges of Saint Victor, the Loire enters the wide and swampy
plain of Forez, after which it again penetrates the hills and
flows out into the plain of Roanne. As in Haute-Loire, it is
joined by a large number of streams, the most important being
the Coise on the right and the Lignon du Nord or du Forez
and the Aix on the left. Below Roanne the Loire is accompanied
on its left bank by a canal to Digoin (35 m.) in Saône-et-Loire,
thence by the so-called &ldquo;lateral canal of the Loire&rdquo; to Briare
in Loiret (122 m.). Owing to the <span class="correction" title="amended from exteme">extreme</span> irregularity of the
river in different seasons these canals form the only certain
navigable way. At Digoin the Loire receives the Arroux, and
gives off the canal du Centre (which utilizes the valley of the
Bourbince) to Chalon-sur-Saône. At this point its northerly
course begins to be interrupted by the mountains of Morvan,
and flowing north-west it enters the department of Nièvre.
Just beyond Nevers it is joined by the Allier; this river rises
30 m. S.W. of the Loire in the department of Lozère, and following
an almost parallel course has at the confluence a volume
equal to two-thirds of that of the main stream. Above Nevers
the Loire is joined by the Aron, along which the canal du
Nivernais proceeds northward, and the Nièvre, and below the
confluence of the Allier gives off the canal du Berry to Bourges
and the navigable part of the Cher. About this point the valley
becomes more ample and at Briare (in Loiret) the river leaves
the highlands and flows between the plateaus of Gatinais and the
Beauce on the right and the Sologne on the left. In Loiret it
gives off the canal de Briare northward to the Seine and itself
bends north-west to Orléans, whence the canal d&rsquo;Orléans,
following the little river Cens, communicates with the Briare
canal. At Orléans the river changes its north-westerly for a
south-westerly course. A striking peculiarity of the affluents
of the Loire in Loiret and the three subsequent departments
is that they frequently flow in a parallel channel to the main
stream and in the same valley. Passing Blois in Loir-et-Cher,
the Loire enters Indre-et-Loire and receives on the right the
Cisse, and, after passing Tours, the three important left-hand
tributaries of the Cher, Indre and the Vienne. At the confluence
of the Vienne the Loire enters Maine-et-Loire, in its course
through which department it is frequently divided by long
sandy islands fringed with osiers and willows; while upon
arriving at Les Ponts-de-Cé it is split into several distinct branches.
The principal tributaries are: left, the Thouet at Saumur, the
Layon and the Evre; right: the Authion, and, most important
tributary of all, the Maine, formed by the junction of the rivers
Mayenne, Sarthe and Loir. Through Loire-Inférieure the river
is studded with islands until below Nantes, where the largest
of them, called Belle-Ile, is found. It receives the Erdre
on the right at Nantes and on the opposite shore the Sèvre-Nantaise,
and farther on the canalized Achenau on the left
and the navigable Etier de Méan on the right near Saint
Nazaire. Below Nantes, between which point and La Martinière
(below Pellerin) the channel is embanked, the river is known
as the Loire Maritime and widens out between marshy shores,
passing Paimb&oelig;uf on the left and finally Saint-Nazaire, where
it is 1½ m. broad. The length of the channel of the Loire is
about 625 m.; its drainage area is 46,700 sq. m. A lateral canal
(built in 1881-1892 at a cost of about £1,000,000) known as the
Maritime Canal of the Loire between Le Carnet and La Martinière
enables large ships to ascend to Nantes. It is 9½ m. long, and
19½ (capable of being increased to 24) ft. deep. At each end is
a lock 405 ft. long by 59 ft. wide. The canal de Nantes à Brest
connects this city with Brest.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Loire is navigable only in a very limited sense. During the
drought of summer thin and feeble streams thread their way between
the sandbanks of the channel; while at other times a stupendous
flood submerges wide reaches of land. In the middle part of its
course the Loire traverses the western portion of the undulating
Paris basin, with its Tertiary marls, sands and clays, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page924" id="page924"></a>924</span>
alluvium carried off from these renders its lower channel inconstant;
the rest of the drainage area is occupied by crystalline rocks, over
the hard surface of which the water, undiminished by absorption,
flows rapidly into the streams. When the flood waters of two or
more tributaries arrive at the same time serious inundations result.
Attempts to control the river must have begun at a very early date,
and by the close of the middle ages the bed between Orléans and
Angers was enclosed by dykes 10 to 13 ft. high. In 1783 a double
line of dykes or <i>turcies</i> 23 ft. high was completed from Bec d&rsquo;Allier
downwards. The channel was, however, so much narrowed that the
embankments are almost certain to give way as soon as the water
rises 16 ft. (the average rise is about 14, and in 1846 and 1856 it
was more than 22). In modern times embankments, aided by
dredging operations extending over a large number of years, have
ensured a depth of 18 ft. in the channel between La Martinière and
Nantes. Several towns have constructed special works to defend
themselves against the floods; Tours, the most exposed of all, is
surrounded by a circular dyke.</p>

<p>Various schemes for the systematic regulation of the Loire have
been discussed. It has been proposed to construct in the upper
valleys of the several affluents a number of gigantic dams or reservoirs
from which the water, stored during flood, could be let off
into the river as required. A dam of this kind (built in 1711) at the
village of Pinay, about 18 m. above Roanne, and capable of retaining
from 350 to 450 million cub. ft. of water, has greatly
diminished the force of the floods at Roanne, and maintained the
comparative equilibrium of the current during the dry season.
Three other dams of modern construction are also in existence, one
near Firminy, the other two near St Étienne.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOIRE,<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> a department of central France, made up in 1793
of the old district of Forez and portions of Beaujolais and
Lyonnais, all formerly included in the province of Lyonnais.
Pop. (1906) 643,943. Area 1853 sq. m. It is bounded N. by
the department of Saône-et-Loire, E. by those of Rhône and
Isère, S. by Ardèche and Haute-Loire, and W. by Puy-de-Dôme
and Allier. From 1790 to 1793 it constituted, along with that
of Rhône, a single department (Rhône-et-Loire). It takes its
name from the river which bisects it from south to north. The
Rhone skirts the S.E. of the department, about one-eighth of
which belongs to its basin. After crossing the southern border
the Loire runs through wild gorges, passing the picturesque
crag crowned by the old fortress of St Paul-en-Cornillon. At
St Rambert it issues into the broad plain of Fotez, flows north
as far as its confluence with the Aix where the plain ends, and
then again traverses gorges till it enters the less extensive plain
of Roanne in the extreme north of the department. These two
plains, the beds of ancient lakes, are enclosed east and west by
chains of mountains running parallel with the river. In the
west are the Forez mountains, which separate the Loire basin
from that of the Allier; their highest point (Pierre sur Haute,
5381 ft.) is 12 m. W. of Montbrison. They sink gradually
towards the north, and are successively called Bois Noirs (4239
ft.), from their woods, and Monts de la Madeleine (3822 to 1640
ft.). In the east the Rhone and Loire basins are separated,
by Mont Pilat (4705 ft.) at the north extremity of the Cévennes,
and by the hills of Lyonnais, Tarare, Beaujolais and Charolais,
none of which rise higher than 3294 ft. Of the affluents of the
Loire the most important are the Lignon du Nord, the beautiful
valley of which has been called &ldquo;La Suisse Forezienne,&rdquo; and the
Aix on the left, and on the right the Ondaine (on which stand
the industrial towns of Chambon-Feugerolles and Firminy),
the Furens and the Rhin. The Gier forms a navigable channel
to the Rhone at Givors, and has on its banks the industrial
towns of St Chamond and Rive-de-Gier. From Mont Pilat
descends the Déôme, in the valley of which are the workshops
of Annonay (<i>q.v.</i>). The climate on the heights is cold and healthy,
it is unwholesome in the marshy plain of Forez, mild in the valley
of the Rhone. The annual rainfall varies from 39 to 48 in. on
the Forez mountains, but only reaches 20 to 24 in. in the vicinity
of Montbrison.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The plains of Forez and Roanne are the two most important
agricultural districts, but the total production of grain within the
department is insufficient for the requirements of the population.
The pasture lands of the plain of Forez, the western portion of
which is irrigated by the canal of Forez, support a large number of
live stock. Good pasturage is also found on the higher levels of
the Forez mountains, on the north-eastern plateaus, where oxen of
the famous Charolais breed are raised, and on the uplands generally.
Wheat and rye are the leading cereal crops; oats come next in
importance, barley and colza occupying a relatively small area.
The vine is cultivated in the valley of the Rhone, on the lower slopes
of the Forez mountains and on the hills west of the plain of Roanne.
The forests of Mont Pilat and the Forez chain yield good-sized pines
and wood for mining purposes. The so-called Lyons chestnuts are
to a large extent obtained from Forez; the woods and pasture lands
of Mont Pilat yield medicinal plants, such as mint. Poultry-rearing
and bee-keeping are considerable industries. The department is
rich in mineral springs, the waters of St Galmier, Sail-sous-Couzan,
St Romain-le-Puy and St Alban being largely exported. The chief
wealth of the department lies in the coal deposits of the basin of
St Étienne (<i>q.v.</i>), the second in importance in France, quarrying is
also active. Metal-working industries are centred in the S.E. of
the department, where are the great manufacturing towns of St
Étienne, Rive-de-Gier, St Chamond and Firminy. At St Étienne
there is a national factory of arms, in which as many as 10,000 have
been employed; apart from other factories of the same kind carried
on by private individuals, the production of hardware, locks, edge-tools,
common cutlery, chain cables for the mines, files, rails, &amp;c.,
occupies thousands of hands. Cast steel is largely manufactured,
and the workshops of the department supply the heaviest constructions
required in naval architecture, as well as war material
and machinery of every description. The glass industry is carried
on at Rive-de-Gier and St Galmier. St Étienne and St Chamond
are centres for the fabrication of silk ribbons, elastic ribbons and
laces, and the dressing of raw silks. Between 50,000 and 60,000
people are employed in the last-named industries. The arrondissement
of Roanne manufactures cotton stuffs, muslins and the like.
That of Montbrison produces table linen. The department has
numerous dye-works, flour-mills, paper works, tanyards, brick-works,
silk-spinning works and hat factories. It is served by the
Paris-Lyon railway, Roanne being the junction of important lines
from Paris to Lyons and St Étienne. Within the department the
Loire is hardly used for commercial navigation; the chief waterways
are the canal from Roanne to Digoin (13 m. in the department),
that from Givors to Rive-de-Gier (7 m.) and the Rhone (7 m.).</p>
</div>

<p>Loire comprises three arrondissements&mdash;St Étienne, Montbrison
and Roanne&mdash;with 31 cantons and 335 communes. It
falls within the region of the XIII. army corps and the <i>diocèse</i>
and <i>académie</i> (educational circumscription) of Lyons, where
also is its court of appeal. St Étienne is the capital, other
leading towns being Roanne, Montbrison, Rive-de-Gier, St
Chamond, Firminy and Le Chambon, all separately noticed.
St Bonnet-le-Château, besides old houses, has a church of the
15th and 16th centuries, containing paintings of the 15th century;
St Rambert and St Romain-le-Puy have priory churches of the
11th and 12th centuries; and at Charlieu there are remains of
a Benedictine abbey founded in the 9th century, including a
porch decorated with fine Romanesque carving.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOIRE-INFÉRIEURE,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> a maritime department of western
France, made up in 1790 of a portion of Brittany on the right
and of the district of Retz on the left of the Loire, and bounded
W. by the ocean, N. by Morbihan and Ille-et-Vilaine, E. by
Maine-et-Loire and S. by Vendée. Pop. (1906) 666,748. Area
2694 sq. m. The surface is very flat, and the highest point, in
the north on the borders of Ille-et-Vilaine, reaches only 377 ft.
The line of hillocks skirting the right bank of the Loire, and
known as the <i>sillon de Bretagne</i>, scarcely exceeds 250 ft.; below
Savenay they recede from the river, and meadows give place
to peat bogs. North of St Nazaire and Grande Brière, measuring
9 m. by 6, and rising hardly 10 ft. above the sea-level, still supplies
old trees which can be used for joiners&rsquo; work. A few scattered
villages occur on the more elevated spots, but communication
is effected chiefly by the canals which intersect it. The district
south of the Loire lies equally low; its most salient feature is
the lake of Grandlieu, covering 27 sq. m., and surrounded by
low and marshy ground, but so shallow (6½ ft. at most) that
drainage would be comparatively easy. The Loire (<i>q.v.</i>) has a
course of 70 m. within the department. On the left bank a
canal stretches for 9 m. between Pellerin, where the dikes which
protect the Loire valley from inundation terminate, and Paimb&oelig;uf,
and vessels drawing 17 or 18 ft. can reach Nantes. The
principal towns on the river within the department are Ancenis,
Nantes and St Nazaire (one of the most important commercial
ports of France) on the right, and Paimb&oelig;uf on the left. The
chief affluents are, on the right the Erdre and on the left the
Sèvre, both debouching at Nantes. The Erdre in its lower
course broadens in places into lakes which give it the appearance
of a large river. Four miles below Nort it coalesces with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page925" id="page925"></a>925</span>
canal from Nantes to Brest. The Sèvre is hemmed in by
picturesque hills; at the point where it enters the department
it flows past the beautiful town of Clisson with its imposing
castle of the 13th century. Apart from the Loire, the only
navigable channel of importance within the department is the
Nantes and Brest canal, fed by the Isac, a tributary of the
Vilaine, which separates Loire-Inférieure from Ille-et-Vilaine
and Morbihan. The climate is humid, mild and equable. At
Nantes the mean annual temperature is 54.7° Fahr., and there
are one hundred and twenty-two rainy days, the annual rainfall
being 25.6 in.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Horse and cattle raising prospers, being carried on chiefly in the
west of the department and in the Loire valley. Good butter and
cheese are produced. Poultry also is reared, and there is a good
deal of bee-keeping. Wheat, oats, buckwheat and potatoes are
produced in great abundance; leguminous plants are also largely
cultivated, especially near Nantes. Wine, cider and forage crops are
the chief remaining agricultural products. The woods are of oak
in the interior and pine on the coast. The department has deposits
of tin, lead and iron. N.W. of Ancenis coal is obtained from a bed
which is a prolongation of that of Anjou. The salt marshes, about
6000 acres in all, occur for the most part between the mouth of the
Vilaine and the Loire, and on the Bay of Bourgneuf, and salt-refining,
of which Guérande is the centre, is an important industry.
The granite of the sea-coast and of the Loire up to Nantes is quarried
for large blocks. Steam-engines are built for the government at
Indret, a few miles below Nantes; the forges of Basse-Indre are in
good repute for the quality of their iron; and the production of
the lead-smelting works at Couëron amounts to several millions of
francs annually. There are also considerable foundries at Nantes,
Chantenay, close to Nantes, and St Nazaire, and shipbuilding yards
at Nantes and St Nazaire. Among other industries may be mentioned
the preparation of pickles and preserved meats at Nantes, the curing
of sardines at Le Croisic and in the neighbouring communes, the
manufacture of sugar, brushes, tobacco, macaroni and similar foods,
soap and chemicals at Nantes, and of paper, sugar and soap at
Chantenay. Fishing is prosecuted along the entire coast, particularly
at Le Croisic. Among the seaside resorts Le Croisic, Pornichet
and Pornic, where there are megalithic monuments, may be mentioned.
The department is traversed by the railways of the state, the Orléans
company and the Western company. The department is divided
into five arrondissements&mdash;Nantes, Ancenis, Châteaubriant, Paimb&oelig;uf
and St Nazaire&mdash;45 cantons and 219 communes. It has
its appeal court at Rennes, which is also the centre of the <i>académie</i>
(educational division) to which it belongs.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal places are Nantes, the capital, St Nazaire
and Châteaubriant, which receive separate treatment. On the
west coast the town of Batz, and the neighbouring villages,
situated on the peninsula of Batz, are inhabited by a small
community possessed of a distinct costume and dialect, and claiming
descent from a Saxon or Scandinavian stock. Its members
are employed for the most part in the salt marshes N.E. of the
town. Guérande has well-preserved ramparts and gates of
the 15th century, a church dating from the 12th to the 16th
centuries, and other old buildings. At St Philbert-de-Grandlieu
there is a church, rebuilt in the 16th and 17th centuries, but
preserving remains of a previous edifice belonging at least to
the beginning of the 11th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOIRET,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> a department of central France, made up of the
three districts of the ancient province of Orléanais&mdash;Orléanais
proper, Gâtinais and Dunois&mdash;together with portions of those
of Île-de-France and Berry. It is bounded N. by Seine-et-Oise,
N.E. by Seine-et-Marne, E. by Yonne, S. by Nièvre and Cher,
S.W. and W. by Loir-et-Cher and N.W. by Eure-et-Loir. Area,
2629 sq. m. Pop. (1906) 364,999. The name is borrowed from
the Loiret, a stream which issues from the ground some miles
to the south of Orléans, and after a course of about 7 m. falls
into the Loire; its large volume gives rise to the belief that it is
a subterranean branch of that river. The Loire traverses the
south of the department by a broad valley which, though
frequently devastated by disastrous floods, is famed for its rich
tilled lands, its castles, its towns and its vine-clad slopes. To
the north of the Loire are the Gâtinais (capital Montargis)
and the Beauce; the former district is so named from its <i>gâtines</i>
or wildernesses, of which saffron is, along with honey, the most
noteworthy product; the Beauce (<i>q.v.</i>), a monotonous tract of
corn-fields without either tree or river, has been called the granary
of France. Between the Beauce and the Loire is the extensive
forest of Orléans, which is slowly disappearing before the advances
of agriculture. South of the Loire is the Sologne, long barren
and unhealthy from the impermeability of its subsoil, but now
much improved in both respects by means of pine plantation
and draining and manuring operations. The highest point
(on the borders of Cher) is 900 ft. above sea-level, and the lowest
(on the borders of Seine-et-Marne) is 220 ft. The watershed
on the plateau of Orléans between the basins of the Seine and
Loire, which divide Loiret almost equally between them, is
almost imperceptible. The lateral canal of the Loire from
Roanne stops at Briare; from the latter town a canal (canal
de Briare) connects with the Seine by the Loing valley, which
is joined by the Orléans canal below Montargis. The only important
tributary of the Loire within the department is the
Loiret; the Loing, a tributary of the Seine, has a course
of 40 m. from south to north, and is accompanied first by the
Briare canal and afterwards by that of the Loing. The Essonne,
another important affluent of the Seine, leaving Loiret
below Malesherbes, takes its rise on the plateau of Orléans, as
also does its tributary the Juine. The department has the
climate of the Sequanian region, the mean temperature being
a little above that of Paris; the rainfall varies from 18.5 to 27.5
in., according to the district, that of the exposed Beauce being
lower than that of the well-wooded Sologne. Hailstorms
cause much destruction in the Loire valley and the neighbouring
regions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The department is essentially agricultural in character. A large
number of sheep, cattle, horses and pigs are reared; poultry,
especially geese, and bees are plentiful. The yield of wheat and
oats is in excess of the consumption; rye, barley, meslin, potatoes,
beetroot, colza and forage plants are also cultivated. Wine in
abundance, but of inferior quality, is grown on the hills of the
Loire valley. Buckwheat supports bees by its flowers, and poultry
by its seeds. Saffron is another source of profit. The woods consist
of oak, elm, birch and pine; fruit trees thrive in the department,
and Orléans is a great centre of nursery gardens. The industries
are brick and tile making, and the manufacture of faience, for which
Gien is one of the most important centres in France. The Briare
manufacture of porcelain buttons and pearls employs many workmen.
Flour-mills are very numerous. There are iron and copper
foundries, which, with agricultural implement making, bell-founding
and the manufacture of pins, nails and files, represent the chief
metal-working industries. The production of hosiery, wool-spinning
and various forms of wool manufacture are also engaged in. A
large quantity of the wine grown is made into vinegar (vinaigre
d&rsquo;Orléans). The tanneries produce excellent leather; and paper-making,
sugar-refining, wax-bleaching and the manufacture of
caoutchouc complete the list of industries. The four arrondissements
are those of Orléans, Gien, Montargis and Pithiviers, with 31
cantons and 349 communes. The department forms part of the
<i>académie</i> (educational division) of Paris.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides Orléans, the capital, the more noteworthy places,
Gien, Montargis, Beaugency, Pithiviers, Briare and St Benoît-sur-Loire,
are separately noticed. Outside these towns notable
examples of architecture are found in the churches of Cléry
(15th century), of Ferrières (13th and 14th centuries), of Puiseaux
(12th and 13th centuries) and Meung (12th century). At
Germigny-des-Prés there is a church built originally at the
beginning of the 9th century and rebuilt in the 19th century,
on the old plan and to some extent with the old materials.
Yèvre-le-Châtel has an interesting château of the 13th century,
and Sully-sur-Loire the fine medieval château rebuilt at the
beginning of the 17th century by Maximilien de Béthune, duke
of Sully, the famous minister of Henry IV. There are remains
of a Gallo-Roman town (perhaps the ancient <i>Vellaunodunum</i>)
at Triguères and of a Roman amphitheatre near Montbouy.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LOIR-ET-CHER,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> a department of central France, formed in
1790 from a small portion of Touraine, the Perche, but chiefly
from the Dunois, Vendômois and Blésois, portions of Orléanais.
It is bounded N. by Eure-et-Loir, N.E. by Loiret, S.E. by Cher,
S. by Indre, S.W. by Indre-et-Loire and N.W. by Sarthe. Pop.
(1906) 276,019. Area, 2479 sq. m. The department takes its
name from the Loir and the Cher by which it is traversed in the
north and south respectively. The Loir rises on the eastern
border of the Perche and joins the Maine after a course of 195 m.;
the Cher rises on the Central Plateau near Aubusson, and reaches
the Loire after a course of 219 m. The Loire flows through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page926" id="page926"></a>926</span>
department from north-east to south-west, and divides it into
two nearly equal portions. To the south-east is the district of
the Sologne, to the north-west the rich wheat-growing country
of the Beauce (<i>q.v.</i>) which stretches to the Loir. Beyond that
river lies the Perche. The surface of this region, which contains
the highest altitude in the department (840 ft.), is varied by
hills, valleys, hedged fields and orchards. The Sologne was
formerly a region of forests, of which those in the neighbourhood
of Chambord are the last remains. Its soil, once barren and
marshy, has been considerably improved by draining and
afforestation, though pools are still very numerous. The district
is much frequented by sportsmen. The Cher and Loir traverse
pleasant valleys, occasionally bounded by walls of tufa in which
dwellings have been excavated, as at Les Roches in the Loir
valley; the stone, hardened by exposure to the air, is also used
for building purposes. The Loire and, with the help of the Berry
canal, the Cher are navigable. The chief remaining rivers of the
department are the Beuvron, which flows into the Loire on the
left, and the Sauldre, a right-hand affluent of the Cher. The
climate is temperate and mild, though that of the Beauce tends
to dryness and that of the Sologne to dampness. The mean
annual temperature is between 52° and 53° F.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The department is primarily agricultural, yielding abundance of
wheat and oats. Besides these the chief products are rye, wheat
and potatoes. Vines thrive on the valley slopes, the vineyards
falling into four groups&mdash;those of the Cher, which yield fine red
wines, the Sologne, the Blésois and the Vendômois. In the valleys
fruit-trees and nursery gardens are numerous; the asparagus of
Romorantin and Vendôme is well-known. The Sologne supplies
pine and birch for fuel, and there are extensive forests around Blois
and on both sides of the Loir. Pasture is of good quality in the
valleys. Sheep are the chief stock; the Perche breed of horses
is much sought after for its combination of lightness and strength.
Bee-farming is of some importance in the Sologne. Formerly the
speciality of Loir-et-Cher was the production of gun-flints. Stone-quarries
are numerous. The chief industries are the cloth-manufacture
of Romorantin, and leather-dressing and glove-making at
Vendôme; and lime-burning, flour-milling, distilling, saw-milling,
paper-making and the manufacture of &ldquo;sabots&rdquo; and boots and
shoes, hosiery and linen goods, are carried on. The department is
served chiefly by the Orléans railway.</p>
</div>

<p>The arrondissements are those of Blois, Romorantin and
Vendôme, with 24 cantons and 297 communes. Loir-et-Cher
forms part of the educational division (<i>académie</i>) of Paris. Its
court of appeal and the headquarters of the V. army corps, to
the regions of which it belongs, are at Orléans. Blois, the capital,
Vendôme, Romorantin and Chambord are noticed separately.
In addition to those of Blois and Chambord there are numerous
fine châteaux in the department, of which that of Montrichard
with its donjon of the 11th century, that of Chaumont dating
from the 15th and 16th centuries, and that of Cheverny (17th
century) in the late Renaissance style are the most important.
Those at St Aignan, Lassay, Lavardin and Cellettes may also be
mentioned. Churches wholly or in part of Romanesque architecture
are found at Faverolles, Selles-sur-Cher, St Aignan and
Suèvres. The village of Trôo is built close to ancient tumuli
and has an interesting church of the 12th century, and among
other remains those of a lazar-house of the Romanesque period.
At Pontlevoy are the church, consisting of a fine choir in the
Gothic style, and the buildings of a Benedictine abbey. At La
Poissonnière (near Montoire) is a small Renaissance manor-house,
in which Ronsard was born in 1524.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LOISY, ALFRED FIRMIN<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (1857-&emsp;&emsp;), French Catholic
theologian, was born at Ambrières in French Lorraine of parents
who, descended from a long line of resident peasantry, tilled
there the soil themselves. The physically delicate boy was put
into the ecclesiastical school of St Dizier, without any intention
of a clerical career; but he decided for the priesthood, and in
1874 entered the Grand Seminaire of Chalons-sur-Marne. Mgr
Meignan, then bishop of Chalons, afterwards cardinal and archbishop
of Tours, ordained him priest in 1879. After being <i>curé</i>
successively of two villages in that diocese, Loisy went in May
1881, to study and take a theological degree, to the Institut
Catholique in Paris. Here he was influenced, as to biblical
languages and textual criticism, by the learned and loyal-minded
Abbé Paulin Martin, and as to a vivid consciousness of the true
nature, gravity and urgency of the biblical problems and an
Attic sense of form by the historical intuition and the mordant
irony of Abbé Louis Duchesne. At the governmental institutions,
Professors Oppert and Halévy helped further to train him.
He took his theological degree in March 1890, by the oral defence
of forty Latin scholastic theses and by a French dissertation,
<i>Histoire du canon de l&rsquo;ancien testament</i>, published as his first
book in that year.</p>

<p>Professor now at the Institut Catholique, he published successively
his lectures: <i>Histoire du canon du N.T.</i> (1891);
<i>Histoire critique du texte et des versions de la Bible</i> (1892); and
<i>Les Évangiles synoptiques</i> (1893, 1894). The two latter works
appeared successively in the bi-monthly <i>L&rsquo;Enseignement biblique</i>,
a periodical written throughout and published by himself.
But already, on the occasion of the death of Ernest Renan,
October 1892, the attempts made to clear up the main principles
and results of biblical science, first by Mgr d&rsquo;Hulst, rector of
the Institut Catholique, in his article &ldquo;La Question biblique&rdquo;
(<i>Le Correspondant</i>, Jan. 25th, 1893), and then by Loisy himself,
in his paper &ldquo;La Question biblique et l&rsquo;inspiration des Écritures&rdquo;
(<i>L&rsquo;Enseignement biblique</i>, Nov.-Dec. 1893), promptly led to serious
trouble. The latter article was immediately followed by Loisy&rsquo;s
dismissal, without further explanation, from the Institut
Catholique. And a few days later Pope Leo XIII. published
his encyclical <i>Providentissimus Deus</i>, which indeed directly
condemned not Abbé Loisy&rsquo;s but Mgr d&rsquo;Hulst&rsquo;s position, yet
rendered the continued publication of consistently critical
work so difficult that Loisy himself suppressed his <i>Enseignement</i>
at the end of 1893. Five further instalments of his <i>Synoptiques</i>
were published after this, bringing the work down to the Confession
of Peter inclusively.</p>

<p>Loisy next became chaplain to a Dominican convent and
girls&rsquo; school at Neuilly-sur-Seine (Oct. 1894-Oct. 1899), and here
matured his apologetic method, resuming in 1898 the publication
of longer articles, under the pseudonyms of Desprès and Firmin
in the <i>Revue du clergé français</i>, and of Jacques Simon in the lay
<i>Revue d&rsquo;histoire et de littérature religieuses</i>. In the former review,
a striking paper upon development of doctrine (Dec. 1st, 1898)
headed a series of studies apparently taken from an already
extant large apologetic work. In October 1899 he resigned his
chaplaincy for reasons of health, and settled at Bellevue, somewhat
farther away from Paris. His notable paper, &ldquo;La Religion
d&rsquo;Israël&rdquo; (<i>Revue du clergé français</i>, Oct. 15th, 1900), the first
of a series intended to correct and replace Renan&rsquo;s presentation
of that great subject, was promptly censured by Cardinal
Richard, archbishop of Paris; and though scholarly and zealous
ecclesiastics, such as the Jesuit Père Durand and Monseigneur
Mignot, archbishop of Albi, defended the general method and
several conclusions of the article, the aged cardinal never rested
henceforward till he had secured a papal condemnation also.
At the end of 1900 Loisy secured a government lectureship at
the École des Hautes Études Pratiques, and delivered there in
succession courses on the Babylonian myths and the first chapters
of Genesis; the Gospel parables; the narrative of the ministry
in the synoptic Gospels; and the Passion narratives in the same.
The first course was published in the <i>Revue d&rsquo;histoire et de
littérature religieuses</i>; and here also appeared instalments of his
commentary on St John&rsquo;s Gospel, his critically important <i>Notes
sur la Genèse</i>, and a <i>Chronique biblique</i> unmatched in its mastery
of its numberless subjects and its fearless yet delicate penetration.</p>

<p>It was, however, two less erudite little books that brought him
a European literary reputation and the culmination of his ecclesiastical
troubles. <i>L&rsquo;Évangile et l&rsquo;église</i> appeared in November
1902 (Eng. trans., 1903). Its introduction and six chapters
present with rare lucidity the earliest conceptions of the Kingdom
of Heaven, the Son of God, the Church, Christian dogma and
Catholic worship; and together form a severely critico-historical
yet strongly Catholic answer to Harnack&rsquo;s still largely pietistic
<i>Wesen des Christentums</i>. It develops throughout the principles
that &ldquo;what is essential in Jesus&rsquo; Gospel is what occupies the
first and largest place in His authentic teaching, the ideas for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page927" id="page927"></a>927</span>
which He fought and died, and not only that idea which we may
consider to be still a living force to day&rdquo;; that &ldquo;it is supremely
arbitrary to decree that Christianity must be essentially what
the Gospel did not borrow from Judaism, as though what the
Gospel owes to Judaism were necessarily of secondary worth&rdquo;;
that &ldquo;whether we trust or distrust tradition, we know Christ only
by means of, athwart and within the Christian tradition&rdquo;;
that &ldquo;the <i>essence of Christianity</i> resides in the fulness and totality
of its life&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;the adaptation of the Gospel to the
changing conditions of humanity is to-day a more pressing need
than ever.&rdquo; The second edition was enlarged by a preliminary
chapter on the sources of the Gospels, and by a third section
for the Son of God chapter. The little book promptly aroused
widespread interest, some cordial sympathy and much vehement
opposition; whilst its large companion the <i>Études évangéliques</i>,
containing the course on the parables and four sections of his
coming commentary on the Fourth Gospel, passed almost unnoticed.
On the 21st of January 1903 Cardinal Richard publicly
condemned the book, as not furnished with an <i>imprimatur</i>, and
as calculated gravely to trouble the faith of the faithful in the
fundamental Catholic dogmas. On the 2nd of February Loisy
wrote to the archbishop: &ldquo;I condemn, as a matter of course, all
the errors which men have been able to deduce from my book,
by placing themselves in interpreting it at a point of view
entirely different from that which I had to occupy in composing
it.&rdquo; The pope refused to interfere directly, and the nuncio,
Mgr Lorenzelli, failed in securing more than ten public adhesions
to the cardinal&rsquo;s condemnation from among the eighty bishops of
France.</p>

<p>Pope Leo had indeed, in a letter to the Franciscan minister-general
(November 1898), and in an encyclical to the French
clergy (September 1899), vigorously emphasized the traditionalist
principles of his encyclical <i>Providentissimus</i> of 1893; he had even,
much to his prompt regret, signed the unfortunate decree of the
Roman Inquisition, January 1897, prohibiting all doubt as to
the authenticity of the &ldquo;Three Heavenly witnesses&rdquo; passage,
1 John v. 7, a text which, in the wake of a line of scholars
from Erasmus downwards, Abbé Paulin Martin had, in 1887,
exhaustively shown to be no older than the end of the 4th
century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Yet in October 1902 he established a &ldquo;Commission
for the Progress of Biblical Studies,&rdquo; preponderantly composed
of seriously critical scholars; and even one month before his
death he still refused to sign a condemnation of Loisy&rsquo;s
<i>Études évangéliques</i>.</p>

<p>Cardinal Sarto became Pope Pius X. on the 4th of August
1903. On the 1st of October Loisy published three new books,
<i>Autour d&rsquo;un petit livre</i>, <i>Le Quatrième Évangile</i> and <i>Le Discours
sur la Montagne</i>. <i>Autour</i> consists of seven letters, on the origin
and aim of <i>L&rsquo;Évangile et l&rsquo;Église</i>; on the biblical question;
the criticism of the Gospels; the Divinity of Christ; the Church&rsquo;s
foundation and authority; the origin and authority of dogma,
and on the institution of the sacraments. The second and third,
addressed respectively to a cardinal (Perraud) and a bishop (Le
Camus), are polemical or ironical in tone; the others are all
written to friends in a warm, expansive mood; the fourth letter
especially, appropriated to Mgr Mignot, attains a grand elevation
of thought and depth of mystical conviction. <i>Le Quatrième
Évangile</i>, one thousand large pages long, is possibly over-confident
in its detailed application of the allegorical method; yet it
constitutes a rarely perfect sympathetic reproduction of a great
mystical believer&rsquo;s imperishable intuitions. <i>Le Discours sur
la Montagne</i> is a fragment of a coming enlarged commentary
on the synoptic Gospels. On the 23rd of December the pope
ordered the publication of a decree of the Congregation of the
Index, incorporating a decree of the Inquisition, condemning
Loisy&rsquo;s <i>Religion d&rsquo;Israël</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Évangile et l&rsquo;Église</i>, <i>Études évangéliques</i>,
<i>Autour d&rsquo;un petit livre</i> and <i>Le Quatrième Évangile</i>. The pope&rsquo;s
secretary of state had on the 19th December, in a letter to
Cardinal Richard, recounted the causes of the condemnation in
the identical terms used by the latter himself when condemning
the <i>Religion d&rsquo;Israël</i> three years before. On the 12th of January
1904 Loisy wrote to Cardinal Merry del Val that he received
the condemnation with respect, and condemned whatever might
be reprehensible in his books, whilst reserving the rights of his
conscience and his opinions as an historian, opinions doubtless
imperfect, as no one was more ready to admit than himself,
but which were the only form under which he was able to represent
to himself the history of the Bible and of religion. Since the
Holy See was not satisfied, Loisy sent three further declarations
to Rome; the last, despatched on the 17th of March, was
addressed to the pope himself, and remained unanswered.
And at the end of March Loisy gave up his lectureship, as he
declared, &ldquo;on his own initiative, in view of the pacification of
minds in the Catholic Church.&rdquo; In the July following he moved
into a little house, built for him by his pupil and friend, the
Assyriologist François Thureau Dangin, within the latter&rsquo;s
park at Garnay, by Dreux. Here he continued his important
reviews, notably in the <i>Revue d&rsquo;histoire et de littérature religieuses</i>,
and published <i>Morceaux d&rsquo;exégèse</i> (1906), six further sections of
his synoptic commentary. In April 1907 he returned to his
native Lorraine, to Ceffonds by Montier-en-Der, and to his
relatives there.</p>

<p>Five recent Roman decisions are doubtless aimed primarily
at Loisy&rsquo;s teaching. The Biblical Commission, soon enlarged
so as to swamp the original critical members, and which had
become the simple mouthpiece of its presiding cardinals, issued
two decrees. The first, on the 27th of June 1906, affirmed, with
some significant but unworkable reservations, the Mosaic
authorship of the Pentateuch; and the second (29th of May
1907) strenuously maintained the Apostolic Zebedean authorship
of the fourth Gospel, and the strictly historical character
of the events and speeches recorded therein. The Inquisition,
by its decree <i>Lamentabili sane</i> (2nd of July 1907), condemned
sixty-five propositions concerning the Church&rsquo;s <i>magisterium</i>;
biblical inspiration and interpretation; the synoptic and fourth
Gospels; revelation and dogma; Christ&rsquo;s divinity, human
knowledge and resurrection; and the historical origin and
growth of the Sacraments, the Church and the Creed. And some
forty of these propositions represent, more or less accurately,
certain sentences or ideas of Loisy, when torn from their context
and their reasons. The encyclical <i>Pascendi Dominici Gregis</i>
(Sept. 6th, 1907), probably the longest and most argumentative
papal utterance extant, also aims primarily at Loisy, although
here the vehemently scholastic redactor&rsquo;s determination to piece
together a strictly coherent, complete a priori system of
&ldquo;Modernism&rdquo; and his self-imposed restriction to medieval
categories of thought as the vehicles for describing essentially
modern discoveries and requirements of mind, make the identification
of precise authors and passages very difficult. And
on the 21st of November 1907 a papal <i>motu proprio</i> declared
all the decisions of the Biblical Commission, past and future,
to be as binding upon the conscience as decrees of the Roman
Congregations.</p>

<p>Yet even all this did not deter Loisy from publishing three
further books. <i>Les Évangiles synoptiques</i>, two large 8vo volumes of
1009 and 798 pages, appeared &ldquo;chez l&rsquo;auteur, à Ceffonds, Montier-en-Der,
Haute-Marne,&rdquo; in January 1908. An incisive introduction
discusses the ecclesiastical tradition, modern criticism; the
second, the first and the third Gospels; the evangelical tradition;
the career and the teaching of Jesus; and the literary form,
the tradition of the text and the previous commentaries. The
commentary gives also a careful translation of the texts. Loisy
recognizes two eye-witness documents, as utilized by all three
synoptists, while Matthew and Luke have also incorporated
Mark. His chief peculiarity consists in clearly tracing a strong
Pauline influence, especially in Mark, which there remodels
certain sayings and actions as these were first registered by the
eye-witness documents. These doctrinal interpretations introduce
the economy of blinding the Jews into the parabolic
teaching; the declaration as to the redemptive character of the
Passion into the sayings; the sacramental, institutional words
into the account of the Last Supper, originally, a solemnly simple
Messianic meal; and the formal night-trial before Caiaphas
into the original Passion-story with its informal, morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page928" id="page928"></a>928</span>
decision by Caiaphas, and its one solemn condemnation of
Jesus, by Pilate. Mark&rsquo;s narratives of the sepulture by Joseph
of Arimathea and of the empty tomb are taken as posterior to
St Paul; the narratives of the infancy in Matthew and Luke as
later still. Yet the great bulk of the sayings remain substantially
authentic; if the historicity of certain words and acts is here
refused with unusual assurance, that of other sayings and deeds
is established with stronger proofs; and the redemptive conception
of the Passion and the sacramental interpretation of the
Last Supper are found to spring up promptly and legitimately
from our Lord&rsquo;s work and words, to saturate the Pauline and
Johannine writings, and even to constitute an element of all three
synoptic Gospels.</p>

<p><i>Simples Réflexions sur le décret Lamentabili et sur l&rsquo;encyclique
Pascendi</i>, 12mo, 277 pages, was published from Ceffonds a few
days after the commentary. Each proposition of the decree is
carefully tracked to its probable source, and is often found to
modify the latter&rsquo;s meaning. And the study of the encyclical
concludes: &ldquo;Time is the great teacher ... we would do wrong
to despair either of our civilization or of the Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Church authorities were this time not slow to act. On
the 14th of February Mgr Amette, the new archbishop of Paris,
prohibited his diocesans to read or defend the two books, which
&ldquo;attack and deny several fundamental dogmas of Christianity,&rdquo;
under pain of excommunication. The abbé again declared &ldquo;it
is impossible for me honestly and sincerely to make the act of
absolute retractation and submission exacted by the sovereign
pontiff.&rdquo; And the Holy Office, on the 7th of March, pronounced
the major excommunication against him. At the end of March
Loisy published <i>Quelques Lettres</i> (December 1903-February 1908),
which conclude: &ldquo;At bottom I have remained in my last writings
on the same line as in the earlier ones. I have aimed at establishing
principally the historical position of the various questions,
and secondarily the necessity for reforming more or less the
traditional concepts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three chief causes appear jointly to have produced M. Loisy&rsquo;s
very absolute condemnation. Any frank recognition of the
abbé&rsquo;s even general principles involves the abandonment of
the identification of theology with scholasticism or even with
specifically ancient thought in general. The abbé&rsquo;s central
position, that our Lord himself held the proximateness of His
second coming, involves the loss by churchmen of the prestige
of directly divine power, since Church and Sacraments, though
still the true fruits and vehicles of his life, death and spirit,
cannot thus be immediately founded by the earthly Jesus himself.
And the Church policy, as old as the times of Constantine,
to crush utterly the man who brings more problems and pressure
than the bulk of traditional Christians can, at the time, either
digest or resist with a fair discrimination, seemed to the
authorities the one means to save the very difficult situation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOJA<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (formerly written <i>Loxa</i>), a town of southern Spain, in the
province of Granada, on the Granada-Algeciras railway. Pop.
(1900) 19,143. The narrow and irregular streets of Loja wind
up the sides of a steep hill surmounted by a Moorish citadel;
many of the older buildings, including a fine Moorish bridge,
were destroyed by an earthquake in December 1884, although
two churches of the early 16th century remained intact. An iron
bridge spans the river Genil, which flows past the town on the
north, forcing a passage through the mountains which encircle
the fertile and beautiful Vega of Granada. This passage would
have afforded easy access to the territory still held by the Moors
in the last half of the 15th century, had not Loja been strongly
fortified; and the place was thus of great military importance,
ranking with the neighbouring town of Alhama as one of the keys
of Granada. Its manufactures consist chiefly of coarse woollens,
silk, paper and leather. Salt is obtained in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Loja, which, has sometimes been identified with the ancient
<i>Ilipula</i>, or with the <i>Lacibi</i> (<i>Lacibis</i>) of Pliny and Ptolemy, first
clearly emerges in the Arab chronicles of the year 890. It was
taken by Ferdinand III. in 1226, but was soon afterwards
abandoned, and was not finally recaptured until the 28th of
May, 1486, when it surrendered to Ferdinand and Isabella after
a siege.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOLLARDS,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> the name given to the English followers of John
Wycliffe; they were the adherents of a religious movement which
was widespread in the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th
centuries, and to some extent maintained itself on to the Reformation.
The name is of uncertain origin; some derive it from
<i>lolium</i>, tares, quoting Chaucer (<i>C.T.</i>, Shipman&rsquo;s Prologue):&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;This Loller heer wil prechen us somwhat ...</p>
<p class="i05">He wolde sowen som difficultee</p>
<p class="i05">Or springen cokkel in our clene corn&rdquo;;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">but the most generally received explanation derives the words
from <i>lollen</i> or <i>lullen</i>, to sing softly. The word is much older than
its English use; there were Lollards in the Netherlands at the
beginning of the 14th century, who were akin to the Fratricelli,
Beghards and other sectaries of the recusant Franciscan type.
The earliest official use of the name in England occurs in 1387
in a mandate of the bishop of Worcester against five &ldquo;poor
preachers,&rdquo; <i>nomine seu ritu Lollardorum confoederatos</i>. It is
probable that the name was given to the followers of Wycliffe
because they resembled those offshoots from the great Franciscan
movement which had disowned the pope&rsquo;s authority and set
before themselves the ideal of <i>Evangelical poverty</i>.</p>

<p>The 14th century, so full of varied religious life, made it
manifest that the two different ideas of a life of separation from
the world which in earlier times had lived on side by side within
the medieval church were irreconcilable. The church chose
to abide by the idea of Hildebrand and to reject that of Francis
of Assisi; and the revolt of Ockham and the Franciscans, of
the Beghards and other spiritual fraternities, of Wycliffe and
the Lollards, were all protests against that decision. Gradually
there came to be facing each other a great political Christendom,
whose rulers were statesmen, with aims and policy of a worldly
type, and a religious Christendom, full of the ideas of separation
from the world by self-sacrifice and of participation in the benefits
of Christ&rsquo;s work by an ascetic imitation. The war between the
two ideals was fought out in almost every country in Europe
in the 14th century. In England Wycliffe&rsquo;s whole life was spent
in the struggle, and he bequeathed his work to the Lollards.
The main practical thought with Wycliffe was that the church,
if true to her divine mission, must aid men to live that life of
evangelical poverty by which they could be separate from the
world and imitate Christ, and if the church ceased to be true to
her mission she ceased to be a church. Wycliffe was a metaphysician
and a theologian, and had to invent a metaphysical
theory&mdash;the theory of <i>Dominium</i>&mdash;to enable him to transfer,
in a way satisfactory to himself, the powers and privileges of
the church to his company of poor Christians; but his followers
were content to allege that a church which held large landed
possessions, collected tithes greedily and took money from
starving peasants for baptizing, burying and praying, could
not be the church of Christ and his apostles.</p>

<p>Lollardy was most flourishing and most dangerous to the
ecclesiastical organization of England during the ten years
after Wycliffe&rsquo;s death. It had spread so rapidly and grown
so popular that a hostile chronicler could say that almost every
second man was a Lollard. Wycliffe left three intimate disciples:&mdash;Nicolas
Hereford, a doctor of theology of Oxford, who had
helped his master to translate the Bible into English; John
Ashton, also a fellow of an Oxford college; and John Purvey,
Wycliffe&rsquo;s colleague at Lutterworth, and a co-translator of the
Bible, with these were associated more or less intimately,
in the first age of Lollardy, John Parker, the strange ascetic
William Smith, the restless fanatic Swynderly, Richard Waytstract
and Crompe. Wycliffe had organized in Lutterworth
an association for sending the gospel through all England, a
company of poor preachers somewhat after the Wesleyan method
of modern times. &ldquo;To be poor without mendicancy, to unite
the flexible unity, the swift obedience of an order, with free
and constant mingling among the poor, such was the ideal of
Wycliffe&rsquo;s &lsquo;poor priests&rsquo;&rdquo; (cf. Shirley, <i>Fasc. Ziz.</i> p. xl.), and,
although proscribed, these &ldquo;poor preachers&rdquo; with portions of
their master&rsquo;s translation of the Bible in their hand to guide
them, preached all over England. In 1382, two years before
the death of Wycliffe, the archbishop of Canterbury got the
Lollard opinions condemned by convocation, and, having been
promised royal support, he began the long conflict of the church
with the followers of Wycliffe. He was able to coerce the
authorities of the university of Oxford, and to drive out of it
the leading Wycliffite teachers, but he was unable to stifle
Oxford sympathies or to prevent the banished teachers preaching
throughout the country. Many of the nobles, like Lords Montacute
and Salisbury, supported the poor preachers, took them
as private chaplains, and protected them against clerical interference.
Country gentlemen like Sir Thomas Latimer of Braybrooke
and Sir Richard Stury protected them, while merchants
and burgesses supported them with money. When Richard II.
issued an ordinance (July 1382) ordering every bishop to arrest
all Lollards, the Commons compelled him to withdraw it. Thus
protected, the &ldquo;poor preachers&rdquo; won masses of the people to
their opinions, and Leicester, London and the west of England
became their headquarters.</p>

<p>The organization must have been strong in numbers, but only
those who were seized for heresy are known by name, and it
is only from the indictments of their accusers that their opinions
can be gathered. The preachers were picturesque figures in long
russet dress down to the heels, who, staff in hand, preached in
the mother tongue to the people in churches and graveyards,
in squares, streets and houses, in gardens and pleasure grounds,
and then talked privately with those who had been impressed.
The Lollard literature was very widely circulated&mdash;books by
Wycliffe and Hereford and tracts and broadsides&mdash;in spite
of many edicts proscribing it. In 1395 the Lollards grew so
strong that they petitioned parliament through Sir Thomas
Latimer and Sir R. Stury to reform the church on Lollardist
methods. It is said that the Lollard Conclusions printed by
Canon Shirley (p. 360) contain the substance of this petition.
If so, parliament was told that temporal possessions ruin the
church and drive out the Christian graces of faith, hope and
charity; that the priesthood of the church in communion with
Rome was not the priesthood Christ gave to his apostles; that
the monk&rsquo;s vow of celibacy had for its consequence unnatural
lust, and should not be imposed; that transubstantiation was
a feigned miracle, and led people to idolatry; that prayers
made over wine, bread, water, oil, salt, wax, incense, altars of
stone, church walls, vestments, mitres, crosses, staves, were
magical and should not be allowed; that kings should possess
the <i>jus episcopale</i>, and bring good government into the church;
that no special prayers should be made for the dead; that auricular
confession made to the clergy, and declared to be necessary
for salvation, was the root of clerical arrogance and the cause
of indulgences and other abuses in pardoning sin; that all wars
were against the principles of the New Testament, and were but
murdering and plundering the poor to win glory for kings;
that the vows of chastity laid upon nuns led to child murder;
that many of the trades practised in the commonwealth, such
as those of goldsmiths and armourers, were unnecessary and
led to luxury and waste. These Conclusions really contain the
sum of Wycliffite teaching; and, if we add that the principal
duty of priests is to preach, and that the worship of images,
the going on pilgrimages and the use of gold and silver chalices
in divine service are sinful (<i>The Peasants&rsquo; Rising and the Lollards</i>,
p. 47), they include almost all the heresies charged in the indictments
against individual Lollards down to the middle of the
15th century. The king, who had hitherto seemed anxious to
repress the action of the clergy against the Lollards, spoke strongly
against the petition and its promoters, and Lollardy never again
had the power in England which it wielded up to this year.</p>

<p>If the formal statements of Lollard creed are to be got from
these Conclusions, the popular view of their controversy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page930" id="page930"></a>930</span>
the church may be gathered from the ballads preserved in the
<i>Political Poems and Songs relating to English History</i>, published
in 1859 by Thomas Wright for the Master of the Rolls series,
and in the Piers Ploughman poems. <i>Piers Ploughman&rsquo;s Creed</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Langland</a></span>) was probably written about 1394, when Lollardy
was at its greatest strength; the ploughman of the <i>Creed</i> is
a man gifted with sense enough to see through the tricks of the
friars, and with such religious knowledge as can be got from the
creed, and from Wycliffe&rsquo;s version of the Gospels. The poet
gives us a &ldquo;portrait of the fat friar with his double chin shaking
about as big as a goose&rsquo;s egg, and the ploughman with his hood
full of holes, his mittens made of patches, and his poor wife going
barefoot on the ice so that her blood followed&rdquo; (<i>Early English
Text Society</i>, vol. xxx., pref., p. 16); and one can easily see why
farmers and peasants turned from the friars to the poor preachers.
The <i>Ploughman&rsquo;s Complaint</i> tells the same tale. It paints popes,
cardinals, prelates, rectors, monks and friars, who call themselves
followers of Peter and keepers of the gates of heaven
and hell, and pale poverty-stricken people, cotless and landless,
who have to pay the fat clergy for spiritual assistance, and asks if
these are Peter&rsquo;s priests. &ldquo;I trowe Peter took no money, for no
sinners that he sold.... Peter was never so great a fole, to
leave his key with such a losell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1399 the Lancastrian Henry IV. overthrew the Plantagenet
Richard II., and one of the most active partisans of the new
monarch was Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury and the most
determined opponent of Lollardy. Richard II. had aided the
clergy to suppress Lollardy without much success. The new
dynasty supported the church in a similar way and not more
successfully. The strength of the anti-clerical party lay in the
House of Commons, in which the representatives of the shires
took the leading part. Twice the Commons petitioned the crown
to seize the temporalities of the church and apply them to such
national purposes as relief of taxation, maintenance of the poor
and the support of new lords and knights. Their anti-clerical policy
was not continuous, however. The court party and the clergy
proposed statutes for the suppression of heresy, and twice at
least secured the concurrence of the Commons. One of these was
the well-known statute <i>De heretico comburendo</i> passed in 1401.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of Lollardy, when the court and the clergy
managed to bring Lollards before ecclesiastical tribunals backed
by the civil power, the accused generally recanted and showed
no disposition to endure martyrdom for their opinions. They
became bolder in the beginning of the 15th century, William
Sawtrey (Chartris), caught and condemned, refused to recant
and was burnt at St Paul&rsquo;s Cross (March 1401), and other
martyrdoms followed. The victims usually belonged to the
lower classes. In 1410 John Badby, an artisan, was sent to the
stake. His execution was memorable from the part taken in it
by the prince of Wales, who himself tried to reason the Lollard
out of his convictions. But nothing said would make Badby
confess that &ldquo;Christ sitting at supper did give to His disciples
His living body to eat.&rdquo; The Lollards, far from daunted, abated
no effort to make good their ground, and united a struggle for
social and political liberty to the hatred felt by the peasants
towards the Romish clergy. Jak Upland (John Countryman)
took the place of Piers Ploughman, and upbraided the clergy,
and especially the friars, for their wealth and luxury. Wycliffe
had published the rule of St Francis, and had pointed out in a
commentary upon the rule how far friars had departed from
the maxims of their founder, and had persecuted the <i>Spirituales</i>
(the Fratricelli, Beghards, Lollards of the Netherlands) for
keeping them to the letter (cf. Matthews, <i>English Works of
Wyclif hitherto unprinted</i>, Early Eng. Text Soc., vol. lxxiv.,
1880). Jak Upland put all this into rude nervous English verse:</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Freer, what charitie is this</p>
<p class="i05">To fain that whoso liveth after your order</p>
<p class="i05">Liveth most perfectlie,</p>
<p class="i05">And next followeth the state of the Apostles</p>
<p class="i05">In povertie and pennance:</p>
<p class="i05">And yet the wisest and greatest clerkes of you</p>
<p class="i05">Wend or send or procure to the court of Rome,</p>
<p class="i05">... and to be assoiled of the vow of povertie.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The archbishop, having the power of the throne behind him,
attacked that stronghold of Lollardy the university of Oxford.
In 1406 a document appeared purporting to be the testimony of
the university in favour of Wycliffe; its genuineness was disputed
at the time, and when quoted by Huss at the council of
Constance it was repudiated by the English delegates. The
archbishop treated Oxford as if it had issued the document,
and procured the issue of severe regulations in order to purge the
university of heresy. In 1408 Arundel in convocation proposed
and carried the famous <i>Constitutiones Thomae Arundel</i> intended
to put down Wycliffite preachers and teaching. They provided
amongst other things that no one was to be allowed to preach
without a bishop&rsquo;s licence, that preachers preaching to the laity
were not to rebuke the sins of the clergy, and that Lollard books
and the translation of the Bible were to be searched for and
destroyed.</p>

<p>When Henry V. became king a more determined effort was
made to crush Lollardy. Hitherto its strength had lain among
the country gentlemen who were the representatives of the
shires. The court and clergy had been afraid to attack this
powerful class. The new king determined to overawe them,
and to this end selected one who had been a personal friend and
whose life had been blameless. This was Sir John Oldcastle,
in right of his wife, Lord Cobham, &ldquo;the good Lord Cobham&rdquo;
as the common people called him. Henry first tried personal
persuasion, and when that failed directed trial for heresy.
Oldcastle was convicted, but was imprisoned for forty days in
the Tower in hope that he might recant. He escaped, and
summoned his co-religionists to his aid. A Lollard plot was
formed to seize the king&rsquo;s person. In the end Oldcastle was burnt
for an obstinate heretic (Dec. 1417). These persecutions were
not greatly protested against; the wars of Henry V. with France
had awakened the martial spirit of the nation, and little sympathy
was felt for men who had declared that all war was but the
murder and plundering of poor people for the sake of kings.
Mocking ballads were composed upon the martyr Oldcastle,
and this dislike to warfare was one of the chief accusations
made against him (comp. Wright&rsquo;s <i>Political Poems</i>, ii. 244).
But Arundel could not prevent the writing and distribution of
Lollard books and pamphlets. Two appeared about the time
of the martyrdom of Oldcastle&mdash;<i>The Ploughman&rsquo;s Prayer</i> and
the <i>Lanthorne of Light</i>. <i>The Ploughman&rsquo;s Prayer</i> declared that
true worship consists in three things&mdash;in loving God, and dreading
God and trusting in God above all other things; and it showed
how Lollards, pressed by persecution, became further separated
from the religious life of the church. &ldquo;Men maketh now great
stonen houses full of glasen windows, and clepeth thilke thine
houses and churches. And they setten in these houses mawmets
of stocks and stones, to fore them they knelen privilich and apert
and maken their prayers, and all this they say is they worship....
For Lorde our belief is that thine house is man&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;
Notwithstanding the repression, Lollardy fastened in new parts
of England, and Lollards abounded in Somerset, Norfolk,
Suffolk, Essex, Lincoln and Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>The council of Constance (1414-1418) put an end to the papal
schism, and also showed its determination to put down heresy
by burning John Huss. When news of this reached England the
clergy were incited to still more vigorous proceedings against
Lollard preachers and books. From this time Lollardy appears
banished from the fields and streets, and takes refuge in houses
and places of concealment. There was no more wayside preaching,
but instead there were <i>conventicula occulta</i> in houses, in
peasants&rsquo; huts, in sawpits and in field ditches, where the Bible
was read and exhortations were given, and so Lollardy continued.
In 1428 Archbishop Chichele confessed that the Lollards seemed
as numerous as ever, and that their literary and preaching work
went on as vigorously as before. It was found also that many
of the poorer rectors and parish priests, and a great many
chaplains and curates, were in secret association with the
Lollards, so much so that in many places processions were never
made and worship on saints&rsquo; days was abandoned. For the
Lollards were hardened by persecution, and became fanatical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page931" id="page931"></a>931</span>
in the statement of their doctrines. Thomas Bagley was accused
of declaring that if in the sacrament a priest made bread into
God, he made a God that can be eaten by rats and mice; that
the pharisees of the day, the monks, and the nuns, and the friars
and all other privileged persons recognized by the church were
limbs of Satan; and that auricular confession to the priest was
the will not of God but of the devil. And others held that any
priest who took salary was excommunicate; and that boys
could bless the bread as well as priests.</p>

<p>From England Lollardy passed into Scotland. Oxford
infected St Andrews, and we find traces of more than one vigorous
search made for Lollards among the teaching staff of the Scottish
university, while the Lollards of Kyle in Ayrshire were claimed
by Knox as the forerunners of the Scotch Reformation.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The opinions of the later Lollards can best be gathered from the
learned and unfortunate Pecock, who wrote his elaborate <i>Repressor</i>
against the &ldquo;Bible-men,&rdquo; as he calls them. He summed up their
doctrines under eleven heads: they condemn the having and using <span class="correction" title="added of">of</span>
images in the churches, the going on pilgrimages to the memorial
or &ldquo;mynde places&rdquo; of the saints, the holding of landed possessions
by the clergy, the various ranks of the hierarchy, the framing of
ecclesiastical laws and ordinances by papal and episcopal authority,
the institution of religious orders, the costliness of ecclesiastical
decorations, the ceremonies of the mass and the sacraments, the
taking of oaths and the maintaining that war and capital punishment
are lawful. When these points are compared with the Lollard
Conclusions of 1395, it is plain that Lollardy had not greatly altered
its opinions after fifty-five years of persecution. All the articles
of Pecock&rsquo;s list, save that on capital punishment, are to be found
in the Conclusions; and, although many writers have held that
Wycliffe&rsquo;s own views differed greatly from what have been called
the &ldquo;exaggerations of the later and more violent Lollards,&rdquo; all
these views may be traced to Wycliffe himself. Pecock&rsquo;s idea was
that all the statements which he was prepared to impugn came from
three false opinions or &ldquo;trowings,&rdquo; viz. that no governance or
ordinance is to be esteemed a law of God which is not founded on
Scripture, that every humble-minded Christian man or woman is
able without &ldquo;fail and defaut&rdquo; to find out the true sense of Scripture,
and that having done so he ought to listen to no arguments to the
contrary; he elsewhere adds a fourth (i. 102), that if a man
be not only meek but also keep God&rsquo;s law he shall have a true
understanding of Scripture, even though &ldquo;no man ellis teche him
saue God.&rdquo; These statements, especially the last, show us the
connexion between the Lollards and those mystics of the 14th century,
such as Tauler and Ruysbroeck, who accepted the teachings of
Nicholas of Basel, and formed themselves into the association of the
Friends of God.</p>
</div>

<p>The persecutions were continued down to the reign of Henry
VIII., and when the writings of Luther began to appear in
England the clergy were not so much afraid of Lutheranism
as of the increased life they gave to men who for generations
had been reading Wycliffe&rsquo;s <i>Wickette</i>. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; wrote Bishop
Tunstall to Erasmus in 1523, &ldquo;no question of pernicious novelty,
it is only that new arms are being added to the great band
of Wycliffite heretics.&rdquo; Lollardy, which continued down to
the Reformation, did much to shape the movement in England.
The subordination of clerical to laic jurisdiction, the reduction
in ecclesiastical possessions, the insisting on a translation of
the Bible which could be read by the &ldquo;common&rdquo; man were
all inheritances bequeathed by the Lollards.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOLLIUS, MARCUS,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> Roman general, the first governor of
Galatia (25 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), consul in 21. In 16, when governor of Gaul,
he was defeated by the Sigambri (Sygambri), Usipetes and
Tencteri, German tribes who had crossed the Rhine. This
defeat is coupled by Tacitus with the disaster of Varus, but
it was disgraceful rather than dangerous. Lollius was subsequently
(2 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) attached in the capacity of tutor and adviser
to Gaius Caesar (Augustus&rsquo;s grandson) on his mission to the
East. He was accused of extortion and treachery to the
state, and denounced by Gaius to the emperor. To avoid
punishment he is said to have taken poison. According to
Velleïus Paterculus and Pliny, he was a hypocrite and cared
for nothing but amassing wealth. It was formerly thought
that this was the Lollius whom Horace described as a model
of integrity and superior to avarice in <i>Od.</i> iv. 9, but it seems
hardly likely that this Ode, as well as the two Lollian epistles of
Horace (i. 2 and 18), was addressed to him. All three must
have been addressed to the same individual, a young man,
probably the son of this Lollius.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOLOS,<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> the name given by the Chinese to a large tribe of
aborigines who inhabit the greater part of southern Szechuen.
Their home is in the mountainous country called Taliang shan,
which lies between the Yangtsze river on the east and the Kien
ch&rsquo;ang valley on the west, in south Szechuen, but they are
found in scattered communities as far south as the Burmese
frontier, and west to the Mekong. There seems no reason to
doubt that they were, like the Miaotze, one of the aboriginal tribes
of China, driven southwards by the advancing flood of Chinese.
The name is said to be a Chinese corruption of Lulu, the name
of a former chieftain of a tribe who called themselves Nersu.
Their language, like the Chinese, is monosyllabic and probably
ideographic, and the characters bear a certain resemblance to
Chinese. No literature, however, worthy of the name is known
to exist, and few can read and write. Politically they are divided
into tribes, each under the government of a hereditary chieftain.
The community consists of three classes, the &ldquo;blackbones&rdquo;
or nobles, the &ldquo;whitebones&rdquo; or plebeians, and the <i>watze</i> or
slaves. The last are mostly Chinese captured in forays, or
the descendants of such captives. Within Lolo-land proper,
which covers some 11,000 sq. m., the Chinese government exercises
no jurisdiction. The Lolos make frequent raids on their unarmed
Chinese neighbours. They cultivate wheat, barley and millet,
but little rice. They have some knowledge of metals, making
their own tools and weapons. Women are said to be held in
respect, and may become chiefs of the tribes. They do not
intermarry with Chinese.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMBARD LEAGUE,<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> the name given in general to any
league of the cities of Lombardy, but applied especially to the
league founded in 1167, which brought about the defeat of the
emperor Frederick I. at Legnano, and the consequent destruction
of his plans for obtaining complete authority over Italy.</p>

<p>Lacking often the protection of a strong ruler, the Lombard
cities had been accustomed to act together for mutual defence,
and in 1093 Milan, Lodi, Piacenza and Cremona formed an
alliance against the emperor Henry IV., in favour of his
rebellious son Conrad. The early years of the reign of
Frederick I. were largely spent in attacks on the privileges of
the cities of Lombardy. This led to a coalition, formed in
March 1167, between the cities of Cremona, Mantua, Bergamo
and Brescia to confine Frederick to the rights which the emperors
had enjoyed for the past hundred years. This league or <i>concordia</i>
was soon joined by other cities, among which were Milan, Parma,
Padua, Verona, Piacenza and Bologna, and the allies began
to build a fortress near the confluence of the Tanaro and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page932" id="page932"></a>932</span>
Bormida, which, in honour of Pope Alexander III., was called
Alessandria. During the absence of Frederick from Italy
from 1168 to 1174, the relations between the pope and the
league became closer, and Alexander became the leader of the
alliance. Meetings of the league were held in 1172 and 1173
to strengthen the bond, and to concert measures against the
emperor, the penalties of the church being invoked to prevent
defection. The decisive struggle began when Frederick attacked
Alessandria in 1174. The fortress was bravely defended, and the
siege was raised on the approach of succour from the allied
cities. Negotiations for peace failed, and the emperor, having
marched against Milan, suffered a severe defeat at Legnano
on the 29th of May 1176. Subsequently Pope Alexander was
detached from his allies, and made peace with Frederick, after
which a truce for six years was arranged between the emperor
and the league. Further negotiations ripened into the peace of
Constance signed on the 25th of June 1183, which granted
almost all the demands of the cities, and left only a shadowy
authority to the emperor (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>).</p>

<p>In 1226, when the emperor Frederick II. avowed his intention
of restoring the imperial authority in Italy, the league was
renewed, and at once fifteen cities, including Milan and Verona,
were placed under the ban. Frederick, however, was not in
a position to fight, and the mediation of Pope Honorius III.
was successful in restoring peace. In 1231 the hostile intentions
of the emperor once more stirred the cities into activity. They
held a meeting at Bologna and raised an army, but as in 1226,
the matter ended in mutual fulminations and defiances. A
more serious conflict arose in 1234. The great question at
issue, the nature and extent of the imperial authority over
the Lombard cities, was still unsettled when Frederick&rsquo;s rebellious
son, the German king Henry VII., allied himself with them.
Having crushed his son and rejected the proffered mediation
of Pope Gregory IX., the emperor declared war on the Lombards
in 1236; he inflicted a serious defeat upon their forces at
Cortenuova in November 1237 and met with other successes,
but in 1238 he was beaten back from before Brescia. In 1239
Pope Gregory joined the cities and the struggle widened out
into the larger one of the Empire and the Papacy. This
was still proceeding when Frederick died in December 1250
and it was only ended by the overthrow of the Hohenstaufen
and the complete destruction of the imperial authority in
Italy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMBARDO,<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> the name of a family of Venetian sculptors and
architects; their surname was apparently Solaro, and the
name of Lombardo was given to the earliest known, Martino,
who emigrated from Lombardy to Venice in the middle of the
15th century and became celebrated as an architect. He had
two sons, Moro and Pietro, of whom the latter (<i>c.</i> 1435-1515)
was one of the greatest sculptors and architects of his time,
while his sons Antonio (d. 1516) and Tullio (d. 1559) were
hardly less celebrated. Pietro&rsquo;s work as an architect is seen in
numerous churches, the Vendramini-Calargi palace (1481), the
doge&rsquo;s palace (1498), the façade (1485) of the <i>scuola</i> of St Mark
and the cathedral of Cividale del Friuli (1502); but he is now
more famous as a sculptor, often in collaboration with his sons;
he executed the tomb of the doge Mocenigo (1478) in the church
of San Giovanni e Paolo at Venice, and a bas-relief for the
tomb of Dante at Ravenna, and in 1483 began the beautiful
decorations in the church of Sta Maria de&rsquo; Miracoli at Venice,
which is associated with his workshop (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Venice</a></span> for numerous
references to the work of the Lombardi). Antonio&rsquo;s masterpiece
is the marble relief of St Anthony making a new-born child
speak in defence of its mother&rsquo;s honour, in the Santo at Padua
(1505). Tullio&rsquo;s best-known works are the four kneeling angels
(1484) in the church of San Martino, Venice, a coronation of
the Virgin in San Giovanni Crisostomo and two bas-reliefs in the
Santo, Padua, besides two others formerly in the Spitzer collection,
representing Vulcan&rsquo;s Forge and Minerva disputing with
Neptune.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMBARDS,<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Langobardi</span>, a Suevic people who appear to
have inhabited the lower basin of the Elbe and whose name is
believed to survive in the modern Bardengau to the south of
Hamburg. They are first mentioned in connexion with the year
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 5, at which time they were defeated by the Romans under
Tiberius, afterwards emperor. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 9, however, after the
destruction of Varus&rsquo;s army, the Romans gave up their attempt
to extend their frontier to the Elbe. At first, with most of the
Suevic tribes, they were subject to the hegemony of Maroboduus,
king of the Marcomanni, but they revolted from him in his war
with Arminius, chief of the Cherusci, in the year 17. We again
hear of their interference in the dynastic strife of the Cherusci
some time after the year 47. From this time they are not
mentioned until the year 165, when a force of Langobardi, in
alliance with the Marcomanni, was defeated by the Romans,
apparently on the Danubian frontier. It has been inferred from
this incident that the Langobardi had already moved southwards,
but the force mentioned may very well have been sent
from the old home of the tribe, as the various Suevic peoples
seem generally to have preserved some form of political union.
From this time onwards we hear no more of them until the end
of the 5th century.</p>

<p>In their own traditions we are told that the Langobardi were
originally called Winnili and dwelt in an island named Scadinavia
(with this story compare that of the Gothic migration, see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Goths</a></span>). Thence they set out under the leadership of Ibor and
Aio, the sons of a prophetess called Gambara, and came into
conflict with the Vandals. The leaders of the latter prayed to
Wodan for victory, while Gambara and her sons invoked Frea.
Wodan promised to give victory to those whom he should see
in front of him at sunrise. Frea directed the Winnili to bring
their women with their hair let down round their faces like beards
and turned Wodan&rsquo;s couch round so that he faced them. When
Wodan awoke at sunrise he saw the host of the Winnili and said,
&ldquo;<i>Qui sunt isti Longibarbi?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Who are these long-beards?&rdquo;&mdash;and
Frea replied, &ldquo;As thou hast given them the name, give them
also the victory.&rdquo; They conquered in the battle and were
thenceforth known as Langobardi. After this they are said to
have wandered through regions which cannot now be identified,
apparently between the Elbe and the Oder, under legendary
kings, the first of whom was Agilmund, the son of Aio.</p>

<p>Shortly before the end of the 5th century the Langobardi
appear to have taken possession of the territories formerly
occupied by the Rugii whom Odoacer had overthrown in 487, a
region which probably included the present province of Lower
Austria. At this time they were subject to Rodulf, king of the
Heruli, who, however, took up arms against them; according
to one story, owing to the treacherous murder of Rodulf&rsquo;s
brother, according to another through an irresistible desire for
fighting on the part of his men. The result was the total defeat
of the Heruli by the Langobardi under their king Tato and the
death of Rodulf at some date between 493 and 508. By this
time the Langobardi are said to have adopted Christianity in
its Arian form. Tato was subsequently killed by his nephew
Waccho. The latter reigned for thirty years, though frequent
attempts were made by Ildichis, a son or grandson of Tato, to
recover the throne. Waccho is said to have conquered the
Suabi, possibly the Bavarians, and he was also involved in strife
with the Gepidae, with whom Ildichis had taken refuge. He
was succeeded by his youthful son Walthari, who reigned only
seven years under the guardianship of a certain Audoin. On
Walthari&rsquo;s death (about 546?) Audoin succeeded. He also was
involved in hostilities with the Gepidae, whose support of
Ildichis he repaid by protecting Ustrogotthus, a rival of their
king Thorisind. In these quarrels both nations aimed at obtaining
the support of the emperor Justinian, who, in pursuance
of his policy of playing off one against the other, invited the
Langobardi into Noricum and Pannonia, where they now settled.</p>

<p>A large force of Lombards under Audoin fought on the imperial
side at the battle of the Apennines against the Ostrogothic king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page933" id="page933"></a>933</span>
Totila in 553, but the assistance of Justinian, though often
promised, had no effect on the relations of the two nations,
which were settled for the moment after a series of truces by the
victory of the Langobardi, probably in 554. The resulting peace
was sealed by the murder of Ildichis and Ustrogotthus, and the
Langobardi seem to have continued inactive until the death of
Audoin, perhaps in 565, and the accession of his son Alboin,
who had won a great reputation in the wars with the Gepidae.
It was about this time that the Avars, under their first Chagun
Baian, entered Europe, and with them, Alboin is said to have
made an alliance against the Gepidae under their new king
Cunimund. The Avars, however, did not take part in the final
battle, in which the Langobardi were completely victorious.
Alboin, who had slain Cunimund in the battle, now took Rosamund,
daughter of the dead king, to be his wife.</p>

<p>In 568 Alboin and the Langobardi, in accordance with a
compact made with Baian, which is recorded by Menander,
abandoned their old homes to the Avars and passed southwards
into Italy, were they were destined to found a new and mighty
kingdom.</p>
<div class="author">(F. G. M. B.)</div>

<p><i>The Lombard Kingdom in Italy.</i>&mdash;In 568 Alboin, king of the
Langobards, with the women and children of the tribe and all
their possessions, with Saxon allies, with the subject tribe of the
Gepidae and a mixed host of other barbarians, descended into
Italy by the great plain at the head of the Adriatic. The war
which had ended in the downfall of the Goths had exhausted
Italy; it was followed by famine and pestilence; and the
government at Constantinople made but faint efforts to retain
the province which Belisarius and Narses had recovered for it.
Except in a few fortified places, such as Ticinum or Pavia, the
Italians did not venture to encounter the new invaders; and,
though Alboin was not without generosity, the Lombards,
wherever resisted, justified the opinion of their ferocity by the
savage cruelty of the invasion. In 572, according to the Lombard
chronicler, Alboin fell a victim to the revenge of his wife Rosamund,
the daughter of the king of the Gepidae, whose skull
Alboin had turned into a drinking cup, out of which he forced
Rosamund to drink. By this time the Langobards had established
themselves in the north of Italy. Chiefs were placed, or
placed themselves, first in the border cities, like Friuli and Trent,
which commanded the north-eastern passes, and then in other
principal places; and this arrangement became characteristic
of the Lombard settlement. The principal seat of the settlement
was the rich plain watered by the Po and its affluents, which was
in future to receive its name from them; but their power extended
across the Apennines into Liguria and Tuscany, and then
southwards to the outlying dukedoms of Spoleto and Benevento.
The invaders failed to secure any maritime ports or any territory
that was conveniently commanded from the sea. Ticinum
(Pavia), the one place which had obstinately resisted Alboin,
became the seat of their kings.</p>

<p>After the short and cruel reign of Cleph, the successor of
Alboin, the Lombards (as we may begin for convenience sake
to call them) tried for ten years the experiment of a national
confederacy of their dukes (as, after the Latin writers, their
chiefs are styled), without any king. It was the rule of some
thirty-five or thirty-six petty tyrants, under whose oppression
and private wars even the invaders suffered. With anarchy
among themselves and so precarious a hold on the country, hated
by the Italian population and by the Catholic clergy, threatened
also by an alliance of the Greek empire with their persistent
rivals the Franks beyond the Alps, they resolved to sacrifice
their independence and elect a king. In 584 they chose Authari,
the grandson of Alboin, and endowed the royal domain with a half
of their possessions. From this time till the fall of the Lombard
power before the arms of their rivals the Franks under Charles
the Great, the kingly rule continued. Authari, &ldquo;the Long-haired,&rdquo;
with his Roman title of Flavius, marks the change
from the war king of an invading host to the permanent representative
of the unity and law of the nation, and the increased
power of the crown, by the possession of a great domain, to enforce
its will. The independence of the dukes was surrendered to the
king. The dukedoms in the neighbourhood of the seat of power
were gradually absorbed, and their holders transformed into royal
officers. Those of the northern marches, Trent and Friuli, with
the important dukedom of Turin, retained longer the kind of
independence which marchlands usually give where invasion
is to be feared. The great dukedom of Benevento in the south,
with its neighbour Spoleto, threatened at one time to be a
separate principality, and even to the last resisted, with varying
success, the full claims of the royal authority at Pavia.</p>

<p>The kingdom of the Lombards lasted more than two hundred
years, from Alboin (568) to the fall of Desiderius (774)&mdash;much
longer than the preceding Teutonic kingdom of Theodoric and
the Goths. But it differed from the other Teutonic conquests
in Gaul, in Britain, in Spain. It was never complete in point of
territory: there were always two, and almost to the last three,
capitals&mdash;the Lombard one, Pavia; the Latin one, Rome; the
Greek one, Ravenna; and the Lombards never could get access
to the sea. And it never was complete over the subject race:
it profoundly affected the Italians of the north; in its turn
it was entirely transformed by contact with them; but the
Lombards never amalgamated with the Italians till their power
as a ruling race was crushed by the victory given to the Roman
element by the restored empire of the Franks. The Langobards,
German in their faults and in their strength, but coarser, at least
at first, than the Germans whom the Italians had known, the
Goths of Theodoric and Totila, found themselves continually
in the presence of a subject population very different from
anything which the other Teutonic conquerors met with among
the provincials&mdash;like them, exhausted, dispirited, unwarlike,
but with the remains and memory of a great civilization round
them, intelligent, subtle, sensitive, feeling themselves infinitely
superior in experience and knowledge to the rough barbarians
whom they could not fight, and capable of hatred such as only
cultivated races can nourish. The Lombards who, after they had
occupied the lands and cities of Upper Italy, still went on sending
forth furious bands to plunder and destroy where they did not
care to stay, never were able to overcome the mingled fear and
scorn and loathing of the Italians. They adapted themselves
very quickly indeed to many Italian fashions. Within thirty
years of the invasions, Authari took the imperial title of Flavius,
even while his bands were leading Italian captives in leash like
dogs under the walls of Rome, and under the eyes of Pope Gregory;
and it was retained by his successors. They soon became
Catholics; and then in all the usages of religion, in church
building, in founding monasteries, in their veneration for relics,
they vied with Italians. Authari&rsquo;s queen, Theodelinda, solemnly
placed the Lombard nation under the patronage of St John the
Baptist, and at Monza she built in his honour the first Lombard
church, and the royal palace near it. King Liutprand (712-744)
bought the relics of St Augustine for a large sum to be
placed in his church at Pavia. Their Teutonic speech disappeared;
except in names and a few technical words all traces
of it are lost. But to the last they had the unpardonable crime
of being a ruling barbarian race or caste in Italy. To the end
they are &ldquo;nefandissimi,&rdquo; execrable, loathsome, filthy. So wrote
Gregory the Great when they first appeared. So wrote Pope
Stephen IV., at the end of their rule, when stirring up the kings
of the Franks to destroy them.</p>

<p>Authari&rsquo;s short reign (584-591) was one of renewed effort for
conquest. It brought the Langobards face to face, not merely
with the emperors at Constantinople, but with the first of the
great statesmen popes, Gregory the Great (590-604). But
Lombard conquest was bungling and wasteful; when they had
spoiled a city they proceeded to tear down its walls and raze it
to the ground. Authari&rsquo;s chief connexion with the fortunes of
his people was an important, though an accidental one. The
Lombard chronicler tells a romantic tale of the way in which
Authari sought his bride from Garibald, duke of the Bavarians,
how he went incognito in the embassy to judge of her attractions,
and how she recognized her disguised suitor. The bride was the
Christian Theodelinda, and she became to the Langobards what
Bertha was to the Anglo-Saxons and Clotilda to the Franks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page934" id="page934"></a>934</span>
She became the mediator between the Lombards and the Catholic
Church. Authari, who had brought her to Italy, died shortly
after his marriage. But Theodelinda had so won on the Lombard
chiefs that they bid her as queen choose the one among them
whom she would have for her husband and for king. She chose
Agilulf, duke of Turin (592-615). He was not a true Langobard,
but a Thuringian. It was the beginning of peace between the
Lombards and the Catholic clergy. Agilulf could not abandon
his traditional Arianism, and he was a very uneasy neighbour,
not only to the Greek exarch, but to Rome itself. But he was
favourably disposed both to peace and to the Catholic Church.
Gregory interfered to prevent a national conspiracy against the
Langobards, like that of St Brice&rsquo;s day in England against the
Danes, or that later uprising against the French, the Sicilian
Vespers. He was right both in point of humanity and of policy.
The Arian and Catholic bishops went on for a time side by side;
but the Lombard kings and clergy rapidly yielded to the religious
influences around them, even while the national antipathies
continued unabated and vehement. Gregory, who despaired of
any serious effort on the part of the Greek emperors to expel the
Lombards, endeavoured to promote peace between the Italians
and Agilulf; and, in spite of the feeble hostility of the exarchs
of Ravenna, the pope and the king of the Lombards became the
two real powers in the north and centre of Italy. Agilulf was
followed, after two unimportant reigns, by his son-in-law, the
husband of Theodelinda&rsquo;s daughter, King Rothari (636-652),
the Lombard legislator, still an Arian though he favoured the
Catholics. He was the first of their kings who collected their
customs under the name of laws&mdash;and he did this, not in their
own Teutonic dialect, but in Latin. The use of Latin implies
that the laws were to be not merely the personal law of the
Lombards, but the law of the land, binding on Lombards and
Romans alike. But such rude legislation could not provide
for all questions arising even in the decayed state of Roman
civilization. It is probable that among themselves the Italians
kept to their old usages and legal precedents where they were
not overridden by the conquerors&rsquo; law, and by degrees a good
many of the Roman civil arrangements made their way into the
Lombard code, while all ecclesiastical ones, and they were a large
class, were untouched by it.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There must have been much change of property; but appearances
are conflicting as to the terms on which land generally was held by
the old possessors or the new comers, and as to the relative legal
position of the two. Savigny held that, making allowance for the
anomalies and usurpations of conquest, the Roman population held
the bulk of the land as they had held it before, and were governed
by an uninterrupted and acknowledged exercise of Roman law in
their old municipal organization. Later inquirers, including Leo,
Troya and Hegel, have found that the supposition does not tally
with a whole series of facts, which point to a Lombard territorial law
ignoring completely any parallel Roman and personal law, to a great
restriction of full civil rights among the Romans, analogous to the
condition of the rayah under the Turks, and to a reduction of the
Roman occupiers to a class of half-free &ldquo;aldii,&rdquo; holding immovable
tenancies under lords of superior race and privilege, and subject
to the sacrifice either of the third part of their holdings or the
third part of the produce. The Roman losses, both of property and
rights, were likely to be great at first; how far they continued
permanent during the two centuries of the Lombard kingdom, or
how far the legal distinctions between Rome and Lombard gradually
passed into desuetude, is a further question. The legislation of the
Lombard kings, in form a territorial and not a personal law, shows
no signs of a disposition either to depress or to favour the Romans,
but only the purpose to maintain, in a rough fashion, strict order
and discipline impartially among all their subjects.</p>
</div>

<p>From Rothari (d. 652) to Liutprand (712-744) the Lombard
kings, succeeding one another in the irregular fashion of the time,
sometimes by descent, sometimes by election, sometimes by
conspiracy and violence, strove fitfully to enlarge their boundaries,
and contended with the aristocracy of dukes inherent in the
original organization of the nation, an element which, though
much weakened, always embarrassed the power of the crown,
and checked the unity of the nation. Their old enemies the
Franks on the west, and the Slavs or Huns, ever ready to break
in on the north-east, and sometimes called in by mutinous and
traitorous dukes of Friuli and Trent, were constant and serious
dangers. By the popes, who represented Italian interests, they
were always looked upon with dislike and jealousy, even when
they had become zealous Catholics, the founders of churches
and monasteries; with the Greek empire there was chronic war.
From time to time they made raids into the unsubdued parts of
Italy, and added a city or two to their dominions. But there
was no sustained effort for the complete subjugation of Italy till
Liutprand, the most powerful of the line. He tried it, and failed.
He broke up the independence of the great southern duchies,
Benevento and Spoleto. For a time, in the heat of the dispute
about images, he won the pope to his side against the Greeks.
For a time, but only for a time, he deprived the Greeks of
Ravenna. Aistulf, his successor, carried on the same policy.
He even threatened Rome itself, and claimed a capitation tax.
But the popes, thoroughly irritated and alarmed, and hopeless of
aid from the East, turned to the family which was rising into
power among the Franks of the West, the mayors of the palace
of Austrasia. Pope Gregory III. applied in vain to Charles
Martel. But with his successors Pippin and Charles the popes
were more successful. In return for the transfer by the pope
of the Frank crown from the decayed line of Clovis to his own,
Pippin crossed the Alps, defeated Aistulf and gave to the pope
the lands which Aistulf had torn from the empire, Ravenna
and the Pentapolis (754-756). But the angry quarrels still went
on between the popes and the Lombards. The Lombards were
still to the Italians a &ldquo;foul and horrid&rdquo; race. At length, invited
by Pope Adrian I., Pippin&rsquo;s son Charlemagne once more
descended into Italy. As the Lombard kingdom began, so
it ended, with a siege of Pavia. Desiderius, the last king,
became a prisoner (774), and the Lombard power perished.
Charlemagne, with the title of king of the Franks and Lombards,
became master of Italy, and in 800 the pope, who had crowned
Pippin king of the Franks, claimed to bestow the Roman empire,
and crowned his greater son emperor of the Romans (800).</p>

<p><i>Effects of the Carolingian Conquest.</i>&mdash;To Italy the overthrow
of the Lombard kings was the loss of its last chance of independence
and unity. To the Lombards the conquest was the destruction
of their legal and social supremacy. Henceforth they
were equally with the Italians the subjects of the Frank kings.
The Carolingian kings expressly recognized the Roman law,
and allowed all who would be counted Romans to &ldquo;profess&rdquo;
it. But Latin influences were not strong enough to extinguish
the Lombard name and destroy altogether the recollections
and habits of the Lombard rule; Lombard law was still recognized,
and survived in the schools of Pavia. Lombardy remained
the name of the finest province of Italy, and for a time
was the name for Italy itself. But what was specially Lombard
could not stand in the long run against the Italian atmosphere
which surrounded it. Generation after generation passed more
and more into real Italians. Antipathies, indeed, survived,
and men even in the 10th century called each other Roman or
Langobard as terms of reproach. But the altered name of
Lombard also denoted henceforth some of the proudest of
Italians; and, though the Lombard speech had utterly perished
their most common names still kept up the remembrance that
their fathers had come from beyond the Alps.</p>

<p>But the establishment of the Frank kingdom, and still more
the re-establishment of the Christian empire as the source of
law and jurisdiction in Christendom, had momentous influence
on the history of the Italianized Lombards. The Empire was
the counterweight to the local tyrannies into which the local
authorities established by the Empire itself, the feudal powers,
judicial and military, necessary for the purposes of government,
invariably tended to degenerate. When they became intolerable,
from the Empire were sought the exemptions, privileges, immunities
from that local authority, which, anomalous and
anarchical as they were in theory, yet in fact were the foundations
of all the liberties of the middle ages in the Swiss cantons, in the
free towns of Germany and the Low Countries, in the Lombard
cities of Italy. Italy was and ever has been a land of cities;
and, ever since the downfall of Rome and the decay of the
municipal system, the bishops of the cities had really been at
the head of the peaceful and industrial part of their population,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page935" id="page935"></a>935</span>
and were a natural refuge for the oppressed, and sometimes for
the mutinous and the evil doers, from the military and civil
powers of the duke or count or judge, too often a rule of cruelty
or fraud. Under the Carolingian empire, a vast system grew
up in the North Italian cities of episcopal &ldquo;immunities,&rdquo; by
which a city with its surrounding district was removed, more
or less completely, from the jurisdiction of the ordinary authority,
military or civil, and placed under that of the bishop. These
&ldquo;immunities&rdquo; led to the temporal sovereignty of the bishops;
under it the spirit of liberty grew more readily than under the
military chief. Municipal organization, never quite forgotten,
naturally revived under new forms, and with its &ldquo;consuls&rdquo;
at the head of the citizens, with its &ldquo;arts&rdquo; and &ldquo;crafts&rdquo; and
&ldquo;gilds,&rdquo; grew up secure under the shadow of the church. In
due time the city populations, free from the feudal yoke, and
safe within the walls which in many instances the bishops had
built for them, became impatient also of the bishop&rsquo;s government.
The cities which the bishops had made thus independent
of the dukes and counts next sought to be free from the bishops;
in due time they too gained their charters of privilege and liberty.
Left to take care of themselves, islands in a sea of turbulence,
they grew in the sense of self-reliance and independence; they
grew also to be aggressive, quarrelsome and ambitious. Thus,
by the 11th century, the Lombard cities had become &ldquo;communes,&rdquo;
commonalties, republics, managing their own affairs,
and ready for attack or defence. Milan had recovered its greatness,
ecclesiastically as well as politically; it scarcely bowed to
Rome, and it aspired to the position of a sovereign city, mistress
over its neighbours. At length, in the 12th century, the inevitable
conflict came between the republicanism of the Lombard
cities and the German feudalism which still claimed their
allegiance in the name of the Empire. Leagues and counter-leagues
were formed; and a confederacy of cities, with Milan
at its head, challenged the strength of Germany under one of
its sternest emperors, Frederick Barbarossa. At first Frederick
was victorious; Milan, except its churches, was utterly destroyed;
everything that marked municipal independence was abolished
in the &ldquo;rebel&rdquo; cities; and they had to receive an imperial
magistrate instead of their own (1158-1162). But the Lombard
league was again formed. Milan was rebuilt, with the help even
of its jealous rivals, and at Legnano (1176) Frederick was utterly
defeated. The Lombard cities had regained their independence;
and at the peace of Constance (1183) Frederick found himself
compelled to confirm it.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>From the peace of Constance the history of the Lombards is
merely part of the history of Italy. Their cities went through the
ordinary fortunes of most Italian cities. They quarrelled and
fought with one another. They took opposite sides in the great
strife of the time between pope and emperor, and were Guelf and
Ghibelline by old tradition, or as one or other faction prevailed in
them. They swayed backwards and forwards between the power
of the people and the power of the few; but democracy and oligarchy
passed sooner or later into the hands of a master who veiled his
lordship under various titles, and generally at last into the hands of
a family. Then, in the larger political struggles and changes of
Europe, they were incorporated into a kingdom, or principality
or duchy, carved out to suit the interest of a foreigner, or to make
a heritage for the nephew of a pope. But in two ways especially
the energetic race which grew out of the fusion of Langobards and
Italians between the 9th and the 12th centuries has left the memory
of itself. In England, at least, the enterprising traders and bankers
who found their way to the West, from the 13th to the 16th centuries,
though they certainly did not all come from Lombardy, bore the
name of Lombards. In the next place, the Lombards or the Italian
builders whom they employed or followed, the &ldquo;masters of Como,&rdquo;
of whom so much is said in the early Lombard laws, introduced a
manner of building, stately, solemn and elastic, to which their
name has been attached, and which gives a character of its own to
some of the most interesting churches in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMBARDY,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> a territorial division of Italy, bounded N. by
the Alps, S. by Emilia, E. by Venetia and W. by Piedmont.
It is divided into eight provinces, Bergamo, Brescia, Como,
Cremona, Mantua, Milan, Pavia and Sondrio, and has an area
of 9386 sq. m. Milan, the chief city, is the greatest railway
centre of Italy; it is in direct communication not only with the
other principal towns of Lombardy and the rest of Italy but
also with the larger towns of France, Germany and Switzerland,
being the nearest great town to the tunnels of the St Gothard
and the Simplon. The other railway centres of the territory
are Mortara, Pavia and Mantua, while every considerable town
is situated on or within easy reach of the railway, this being rendered
comparatively easy owing to the relative flatness of the greater
part of the country. The line from Milan to Porto Ceresio is
worked in the main by electric motor driven trains, while on
that from Lecco to Colico and Chiavenna over-head wires are
adopted. The more remote districts and the immediate environs
of the larger town are served by steam tramways and electric
railways. The most important rivers are the Po, which follows,
for the most part, the southern boundary of Lombardy, and
the Ticino, one of the largest tributaries of the Po, which forms
for a considerable distance the western boundary. The majority
of the Italian lakes, those of Garda, Idro, Iseo, Como, Lugano,
Varese and Maggiore, lie wholly or in part within it. The
climate of Lombardy is thoroughly continental; in summer
the heat is greater than in the south of Italy, while the winter
is very cold, and bitter winds, snow and mist are frequent. In the
summer rain is rare beyond the lower Alps, but a system of irrigation,
unsurpassed in Europe, and dating from the middle ages,
prevails, so that a failure of the crops is hardly possible. There
are three zones of cultivation: in the mountains, pasturage;
the lower slopes are devoted to the culture of the vine, fruit-trees
(including chestnuts) and the silkworm; while in the regions
of the plain, large crops of maize, rice, wheat, flax, hemp and
wine are produced, and thousands of mulberry-trees are grown
for the benefit of the silkworms, the culture of which in the
province of Milan has entirely superseded the sheep-breeding
for which it was famous during the middle ages. Milan is indeed
the principal silk market in the world. In 1905 there were 490
mills reeling silk in Lombardy, with 35,407 workers, and 276
throwing-mills with 586,000 spindles. The chief centre of silk
weaving is Como, but the silk is commercially dealt with at
Milan, and there is much exportation. A considerable amount
of cotton is manufactured, but most of the raw cotton (600,000
bales) is imported, the cultivation being insignificant in Italy.
There are 400 mills in Lombardy, 277 of which are in the province
of Milan. The largest linen and woollen mills in Italy are situated
at Fara d&rsquo;Adda. Milan also manufactures motor-cars, though
Turin is the principal centre in Italy for this industry. There
are copper, zinc and iron mines, and numerous quarries of marble,
alabaster and granite. In addition to the above industries the
chief manufactures are hats, rope and paper-making, iron-casting,
gun-making, printing and lithography. Lombardy is indeed the
most industrial district of Italy. In parts the peasants suffer
much from <i>pellagra</i>.</p>

<p>The most important towns with their communal population
in the respective provinces, according to the census of 1901, are
Bergamo (46,861), Treviglio (14,897), total of province 467,549,
number of communes 306; Brescia (69,210), Chiari (10,749),
total of province 541,765, number of communes 280; Como
(38,174), Varese (17,666), Cantù (10,725), Lecco (10,352), total of
province 594,304, number of communes 510; Cremona (36,848),
Casalmaggiore (16,407), Soresina (10,358), total of province
329,471, number of communes 133; Mantua (30,127), Viadana
(16,082), Quistello (11,228), Suzzara (11,502), St Benedetto Po
(10,908), total of province 315,448, number of communes 68;
Milan (490,084), Monza (42,124), Lodi (26,827), Busto Arsizio
(20,005), Legnano (18,285), Seregno (12,050), Gallarate (11,952),
Codogno (11,925), total of province 1,450,214, number of communes
297; Pavia (33,922), Vigevano (23,560), Voghera (20,442),
total of province 504,382, number of communes 221; Sondrio
(7077), total of province 130,966, number of communes 78.
The total population of Lombardy was 4,334,099. In most of
the provinces of Lombardy there are far more villages than
in other parts of Italy except Piedmont; this is attributable
partly to their mountainous character, partly perhaps to security
from attack by sea (contrast the state of things in Apulia).</p>

<p>Previous to the fall of the Roman republic Lombardy formed
a part of Gallia Transpadana, and it was Lombardy, Venetia
and Piedmont, the portion of the Italian peninsula N. of the Po,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page936" id="page936"></a>936</span>
that did not receive citizenship in 89 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> but only Latin rights.
The gift of full citizenship in 49 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> made it a part of Italy
proper, and Lombardy and Piedmont formed the 11th region of
Augustus (Transpadana) while Venetia and Istria formed the
10th. It was the second of the regions of Italy in size, but the
last in number of towns; it appears, however, to have been
prosperous and peaceful, and cultivation flourished in its fertile
portions. By the end of the 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> the name Liguria
had been extended over it, and Milan was regarded as the
capital of both. Stranger still, in the 6th century the old Liguria
was separated from it, and under the name of <i>Alpes Cottiae</i>
formed the 5th Lombard province of Italy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMBOK<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (called by the natives <i>Sasak</i>), one of the Lesser
Sunda Islands, in the Dutch East Indies, E. of Java, between
8° 12&prime; and 9° 1&prime; S. and 115° 46&prime; and 116° 40&prime; E., with an area of
3136 sq. m. It is separated from Bali by the Strait of Lombok
and from Sumbawa by the Strait of Alas. Rising out of the sea
with bold and often precipitous coasts, Lombok is traversed by
two mountain chains. The northern chain is of volcanic formation,
and contains the peak of Lombok (11,810 ft.), one of the
highest volcanoes in the Malay Archipelago. It is surrounded
by a plateau (with lower summits, and a magnificent lake,
Segara Anak) 8200 ft. high. The southern chain rises a little
over 3000 ft. Between the two chains is a broad valley or terrace
with a range of low volcanic hills. Forest-clad mountains and
stretches of thorny jungle alternating with rich alluvial plains,
cultivated like gardens under an ancient and elaborate system
of irrigation, make the scenery of Lombok exceedingly attractive.
The small rivers serve only for irrigation and the growing of
rice, which is of superior quality. In the plains are also grown
coffee, indigo, maize and sugar, katyang (native beans), cotton
and tobacco. All these products are exported. To the naturalist
Lombok is of particular interest as the frontier island of the
Australian region, with its cockatoos and megapods or mound-builders,
its peculiar bee-eaters and ground thrushes. The
Sasaks must be considered the aborigines, as no trace of an
earlier race is found. They are Mahommedans and distinct in
many other respects from the Hindu Balinese, who vanquished
but could not convert them. The island was formerly divided
into the four states of Karang-Asam Lombok on the W. side,
Mataram in the N.W., Pagarawan in the S.W. and Pagutan
in the E. Balinese supremacy dated from the conquest by Agong
Dahuran in the beginning of the 19th century; the union under
a single raja tributary to Bali dated from 1839. In July 1894
a Dutch expedition landed at Ampanam, and advanced towards
Mataram, the capital of the Balinese sultan, who had defied
Dutch authority and refused to send the usual delegation to
Batavia. The objects of that expedition were to punish Mataram
and to redress the grievances of the Sasaks whom the Balinese
held in cruel subjection. The first Dutch expedition met with
reverses, and ultimately the invaders were forced back upon
Ampanam. The Dutch at once despatched a much stronger
expedition, which landed at Ampanam in September. Mataram
was bombarded by the fleet, and the troops stormed the sultan&rsquo;s
stronghold, and Tjakra Negara, another chieftain&rsquo;s citadel,
both after a desperate resistance. The old sultan of Mataram
was captured, and he and other Balinese chiefs were exiled to
different parts of the Malay Archipelago, whilst the sultan&rsquo;s
heir fell at the hands of his warriors. Thus ended the Balinese
domination of Lombok, and the island was placed under direct
Dutch-Indian control, an assistant resident being appointed
at Ampanam. Lombok is now administered from Bali by the
Dutch resident on that island. The people, however, are in
undisturbed exercise of their own laws, religions, customs and
institutions. Disturbances between the Sasaks and the Lombok
Balinese frequently occur. Lombok has been divided since
1898 into the West, Middle and East Lombok. Its chief towns
are Mataram, Praya and Sisi. On the west coast the harbour
of Ampanam is the most frequented, though, on account of
heavy breakers, it is often difficult of approach. The Sasaks
are estimated at 320,000, the Balinese at 50,000, Europeans
number about 40, Chinese 300, and Arabs 170.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>See A. R. Wallace, <i>Malay Archipelago</i> (London, 1869, and later
editions). The famous &ldquo;Wallace&rsquo;s Line&rdquo; runs immediately west
of Lombok, which therefore has an important part in the work.
Captain W. Cool, <i>With the Dutch in the East</i> (Amsterdam and London,
1897), in Dutch and English, is a narrative of the events sketched
above, and contains many particulars about the folklore and dual
religions of Lombok, which, with Bali, forms the last stronghold of
Hinduism east of Java.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMBROSO, CESARE<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (1836-1909), Italian criminologist,
was born on the 18th of November 1836 at Verona, of a Jewish
family. He studied at Padua, Vienna and Paris, and was
in 1862 appointed professor of psychiatry at Pavia, then director
of the lunatic asylum at Pesaro, and later professor of forensic
medicine and of psychiatry at Turin, where he eventually filled
the chair of criminal anthropology. His works, several of
which have been translated into English, include <i>L&rsquo;Uomo delinquente</i>
(1889); <i>L&rsquo;Uomo di genio</i> (1888); <i>Genio e follia</i> (1877)
and <i>La Donna delinquente</i> (1893). In 1872 he had made the
notable discovery that the disorder known as <i>pellagra</i> was due
(but see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pellagra</a></span>) to a poison contained in diseased maize,
eaten by the peasants, and he returned to this subject in <i>La
Pellagra in Italia</i> (1885) and other works. Lombroso, like
Giovanni Bovio (b. 1841), Enrico Ferri (b. 1856) and Colajanni,
well-known Italian criminologists, and his sons-in-law G. Ferrero
and Carrara, was strongly influenced by Auguste Comte, and
owed to him an exaggerated tendency to refer all mental facts
to biological causes. In spite of this, however, and a serious
want of accuracy and discrimination in handling evidence,
his work made an epoch in criminology; for he surpassed
all his predecessors by the wide scope and systematic character
of his researches, and by the practical conclusions he drew
from them. Their net theoretical results is that the criminal
population exhibits a higher percentage of physical, nervous
and mental anomalies than non-criminals; and that these
anomalies are due partly to degeneration, partly to atavism.
The criminal is a special type of the human race, standing
midway between the lunatic and the savage. This doctrine
of a &ldquo;criminal type&rdquo; has been gravely criticized, but is admitted
by all to contain a substratum of truth. The practical reform
to which it points is a classification of offenders, so that the born
criminal may receive a different kind of punishment from the
offender who is tempted into crime by circumstances (see
also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Criminology</a></span>). Lombroso&rsquo;s biological principles are much
less successful in his work on Genius, which he explains as a
morbid, degenerative condition, presenting analogies to insanity,
and not altogether alien to crime. In 1899 he published in
French a book which gives a résumé of much of his earlier work,
entitled <i>Le Crime, causes et remèdes</i>. Later works are: <i>Delitti
vecchi e delitti nuovi</i> (Turin, 1902); <i>Nuovi studi sul genio</i> (2 vols.,
Palermo, 1902); and in 1908 a work on spiritualism (Eng. trans.,
<i>After Death&mdash;What?</i> 1909), to which subject he had turned
his attention during the later years of his life. He died suddenly
from a heart complaint at Turin on the 19th of October 1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMÉNIE DE BRIENNE, ÉTIENNE CHARLES DE<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1727-1794),
French politician and ecclesiastic, was born at Paris
on the 9th of October 1727. He belonged to a Limousin family,
dating from the 15th century, and after a brilliant career as a
student entered the Church, as being the best way to attain
to a distinguished position. In 1751 he became a doctor of
theology, though there were doubts as to the orthodoxy of his
thesis. In 1752 he was appointed grand vicar to the archbishop
of Rouen. After visiting Rome, he was made bishop of Condom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page937" id="page937"></a>937</span>
(1760), and in 1763 was translated to the archbishopric of
Toulouse. He had many famous friends, among them A. R. J.
Turgot, the Abbé A. Morellet and Voltaire, and in 1770 became
an academician. He was on three occasions the head of the
<i>bureau de jurisdiction</i> at the general assembly of the clergy;
he also took an interest in political and social questions of the
day, and addressed to Turgot a number of <i>mémoires</i> on these
subjects, one of them, treating of pauperism, being especially
remarkable. In 1787 he was nominated as president of the
Assembly of Notables, in which capacity he attacked the fiscal
policy of Calonne, whom he succeeded as head of the <i>conseil des
finances</i> on the 1st of May 1787. Once in power, he succeeded
in making the parlement register edicts dealing with internal
free trade, the establishment of provincial assemblies and the
redemption of the <i>corvée</i>; on their refusal to register edicts
on the stamp duty and the proposed new general land-tax,
he persuaded the king to hold a <i>lit de justice</i>, to enforce their
registration. To crush the opposition to these measures, he
persuaded the king to exile the parlement to Troyes (August
15th, 1787). On the agreement of the parlement to sanction
a prolongation for two years to the tax of the two <i>vingtièmes</i>
(a direct tax on all kinds of income), in lieu of the above two
taxes, he recalled the councillors to Paris. But a further attempt
to force the parlement to register an edict for raising a loan
of 120 million <i>livres</i> met with determined opposition. The
struggle of the parlement against the incapacity of Brienne
ended on the 8th of May in its consenting to an edict for its
own abolition; but with the proviso that the states-general
should be summoned to remedy the disorders of the state.
Brienne, who had in the meantime been made archbishop of
Sens, now found himself face to face with almost universal
opposition; he was forced to suspend the <i>Cour plénière</i> which
had been set up to take the place of the parlement, and himself
to promise that the states-general should be summoned. But
even these concessions were not able to keep him in power,
and on the 29th of August he had to retire, leaving the treasury
empty. On the 15th of December following, he was made
a cardinal, and went to Italy, where he spent two years. After
the outbreak of the Revolution he returned to France, and took
the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">French Revolution</a></span>). He was repudiated by the pope, and
in 1791 had to give up the biretta at the command of Pius VI.
Both his past and present conduct made him an object of suspicion
to the revolutionaries; he was arrested at Sens on the 9th of
November 1793, and died in prison, either of an apoplectic
stroke or by poison, on the 16th of February 1794.</p>

Dauphin</i> (Paris, 1766); <i>Compte-rendu au roi</i> (Paris, 1788); <i>Le

Falloch. Ben Lomond (3192 ft.), the ascent of which is made
with comparative ease from Rowardennan, dominates the landscape;
but there are other majestic hills, particularly on the
west and north-west banks. The fish are sea-trout, lake-trout,
pike and perch. Part of the shore is skirted by the West Highland
railway, opened in 1894, which has stations on the loch at
Tarbet and Ardlui, and Balloch is the terminus of the lines from
Dumbarton and from Stirling via Buchlyvie. Steamers make the
tour of the loch, starting from Balloch and calling at Balmaha,
Luss, Rowardennan, Tarbet, Inversnaid and Ardlui. <span class="sc">Luss</span> has
a considerable population, and there is some stone quarried near
it. <span class="sc">Inversnaid</span> is the point of arrival and departure for the
Trossachs coaches, and here, too, there is a graceful waterfall,
fed by the Arklet from the loch of that name, 2½ m. to the east,
commemorated in Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem of the &ldquo;Highland Girl.&rdquo;
Inversnaid was in the heart of the Macgregor country, and the
name of Rob Roy is still given to his cave on the loch side a mile
to the north and to his prison 3 m. to the south. Inversnaid
was the site of a fort built in 1713 to reduce the clan to subjection.
Craig Royston, a tract lying between Inversnaid and
Ben Lomond, was also associated with Rob Roy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMONÓSOV, MIKHAIL VASILIEVICH<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1711-1765), Russian
poet and man of science, was born in the year 1711, in the village
of Denisovka (the name of which was afterwards changed in
honour of the poet), situated on an island not far from Kholmogorî,
in the government of Archangel. His father, a fisherman,
took the boy when he was ten years of age to assist him in his
calling; but the lad&rsquo;s eagerness for knowledge was unbounded.
The few books accessible to him he almost learned by heart;
and, seeing that there was no chance of increasing his stock of
knowledge in his native place, he resolved to betake himself to
Moscow. An opportunity occurred when he was seventeen,
and by the intervention of friends he obtained admission into
the Zaikonospasski school. There his progress was very rapid,
especially in Latin, and in 1734 he was sent from Moscow to St
Petersburg. There again his proficiency, especially in physical
science, was marked, and he was one of the young Russians
chosen to complete their education in foreign countries. He
accordingly commenced the study of metallurgy at Marburg;
he also began to write poetry, imitating German authors, among
whom he is said to have especially admired Günther. His <i>Ode
on the Taking of Khotin from the Turks</i> was composed in 1739,
and attracted a great deal of attention at St Petersburg. During
his residence in Germany Lomonósov married a native of the
country, and found it difficult to maintain his increasing family
on the scanty allowance granted to him by the St Petersburg
Academy, which, moreover, was irregularly sent. His circumstances
became embarrassed, and he resolved to leave the country
secretly and to return home. On his arrival in Russia he rapidly
rose to distinction, and was made professor of chemistry in the
university of St Petersburg; he ultimately became rector, and
in 1764 secretary of state. He died in 1765.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The most valuable of the works of Lomonósov are those relating
to physical science, and he wrote upon many branches of it. He
everywhere shows himself a man of the most varied learning. He
compiled a Russian grammar, which long enjoyed popularity, and
did much to improve the rhythm of Russian verse.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOMZA,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Lomzha</span>, a government of Russian Poland, bounded
N. by Prussia and the Polish government of Suwalki, E. by the
Russian government of Grodno, S. by the Polish governments
of Siedlce and Warsaw and W. by that of Plock. It covers
4666 sq. m. It is mostly flat or undulating, with a few tracts
in the north and south-west where the deeply cut valleys give a
hilly aspect to the country. Extensive marshes overspread it,
especially on the banks of the Narev, which flows from east to
south-west, joining the Bug in the south-western corner of the
government. The Bug flows along the southern border, joining
the Vistula 20 m. below its confluence with the Narev. There
are forests in the east of the government. The inhabitants
numbered 501,385 in 1872 and 585,033 in 1897, of whom 279,279
were women, and 69,834 lived in towns. The estimated population
in 1906 was 653,100. By religion 77½% are Roman
Catholics, 15½% Jews and 5½% members of the Orthodox
Church. Agriculture is the predominant industry, the chief
crops being rye, oats, wheat, barley, buckwheat, peas, potatoes,
flax and hemp. Bees are extensively kept, and large numbers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page938" id="page938"></a>938</span>
poultry, especially geese, are reared. Stock raising is carried
on to some extent. The wood trade is important; other industries
are the production of pottery, beer, flour, leather,
bricks, wooden wares, spirits, tobacco and sugar. There is only
one railway (between Grodno and Warsaw); the Bug is navigable,
but wood only is floated down the Narev. The government
is divided into seven districts, of which the chief towns,
with their populations in 1897, are Lomza (<i>q.v.</i>), Ostrolenka
(8679), Mazowiec (3900), Ostrów (11,264), Maków (7232), Kolno
(4941) and Szczuczyn (5725).</p>

It was well fortified and had two citadels, but nevertheless often
suffered from the invasions of the Germans and Tatars, and in the
17th century it was twice plundered by the Cossacks of the
Ukraine. In 1795 it fell under the dominion of Prussia, and
after the peace of Tilsit (1807) it came under Russian rule.</p>

for the manufacture of agricultural implements and of railway

<p><span class="bold">LONDON,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> the capital of England and of the British Empire,
and the greatest city in the world, lying on each side of the
river Thames 50 m. above its mouth.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The &ldquo;City,&rdquo; so called
both formally and popularly, is a small area (673 acres) on the
north bank of the river, forming the heart of the metropolis,
and constituting within its boundaries one only, and one of the
smallest, of twenty-nine municipal divisions which make up the
administrative County of London. The twenty-eight remaining
divisions are the Metropolitan Boroughs. The county thus
defined has an extreme length (E. to W.) of 16 m., an extreme
breadth (N. to S.) of 11½ m., and an area of 74,839 acres or about
117 sq. m. The boroughs are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>North of the Thames.</i>&mdash;Touching the northern boundary
of the county, from W. to E.&mdash;Hammersmith, Kensington,
Paddington, Hampstead, St Pancras, Islington, Stoke Newington,

(here the City of London intervenes), Stepney, Poplar.</p>

<p>Between Westminster, the City and Stepney, and the northern

<p>2. <i>South of the Thames.</i>&mdash;Wandsworth, Battersea, Lambeth,
Southwark, Camberwell, Bermondsey, Deptford, Lewisham,
Greenwich, Woolwich (with a small part of the north bank).</p>

<p>These names are all in common use, though their formal
application is in some cases extended over several districts
of which the ancient names remain familiar. Each borough
is noticed in a separate article.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">I. <span class="sc">Extent and Site</span></p>

<p>The County of London is bounded N. and W. by Middlesex,
E. by Essex and Kent, S. by Kent and Surrey. The
Metropolitan police area, or &ldquo;Greater London,&rdquo; however,
embraces the whole of Middlesex, with parts of the other
three counties and of Hertfordshire. Its extent is 443,419
acres or nearly 693 sq. m., and its population is about seven
millions. Only here and there upon its fringe the identity
of this great area with the metropolis is lost to the eye,
where open country remains unbroken by streets or close-set
buildings.</p>

<p><i>Site.</i>&mdash;North of the Thames, and west of its tributary the
Lea, which partly bounds the administrative county on the east,
London is built upon a series of slight undulations, only rarely
sufficient to make the streets noticeably steep. On the northern
boundary of the county a height of 443 ft. is found on the open
Hampstead Heath. The lesser streams which flow from this
high ground to the Thames are no longer open. Some, however,
as well as other natural features effaced by the growth of the
city, retain an historical interest through the survival of their
names in streets and districts, or through their relation to the
original site of London (in the present City). South of the
Thames a broken amphitheatre of low hills, approaching the
river near Greenwich and Woolwich on the east and Putney
and Richmond on the west, encloses a tract flatter than that
to the north, and rises more abruptly in the southern districts
of Streatham, Norwood and Forest Hill.</p>

<p>In attempting to picture the site of London in its original
condition, that is, before any building took place, it is necessary
to consider (1) the condition of the Thames unconfined between
made banks, (2) the slopes overlooking it, (3) the tributary
streams which watered these slopes. The low ground between
the slight hills flanking the Thames valley, and therefore mainly
south of the present river, was originally occupied by a shallow
lagoon of estuarine character, tidal, and interspersed with marshy
tracts and certain islets of relatively firm land. Through this
the main stream of the Thames pursued an ill-defined course.
The tributary streams entered through marshy channels. The
natural process of sedimentation assisted the gradual artificial
drainage of the marshes by means of embankments confining
the river. The breadth of this low tract, from Chelsea downward,
was from 2 to 3 m. The line of the foot of the southern hills,
from Putney, where it nearly approaches the present river,
lies through Stockwell and Camberwell to Greenwich, where
it again approaches the river. On the north there is a flat tract
between Chelsea and Westminster, covering Pimlico, but from
Westminster down to the Tower there is a marked slope directly
up from the river bank. Lower still, marshes formerly extended
far up the valley of the Lea. The higher slopes of the hills were
densely forested (cf. the modern district-name St John&rsquo;s Wood),
while the lower slopes, north of the river, were more open (cf.
Moor-gate). The original city grew up on the site of the City
of London of the present day, on a slight eminence intersected
by the Wal- or Wall-brook, and flanked on the west by the
river Fleet.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:950px; height:677px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img938a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="noind f80"><a href="images/img938b.jpg">(Click to enlarge.)</a></p>

<p class="pt2">These and other tributary streams have been covered in and
built over (in some cases serving as sewers), but it is possible
to trace their valleys at various points by the fall and rise of
streets crossing them, and their names survive, as will be seen,
in various modern applications. The Wallbrook rose in a marsh
in the modern district of Finsbury, and joined the Thames close
to the Cannon Street railway bridge. A street named after it
runs south from the Mansion House parallel with its course.
The Fleet was larger, rising in, and collecting various small
streams from, the high ground of Hampstead. It passed Kentish
Town, Camden Town and King&rsquo;s Cross, and followed a line
approximating to King&rsquo;s Cross Road. The slope of Farringdon
Road, where crossed by Holborn Viaduct, and of New Bridge
Street, Blackfriars, marks its course exactly, and that of Fleet
Street and Ludgate Hill its steep banks. The name also appears
in Fleet Road, Hampstead. From King&rsquo;s Cross downward
the banks were so steep and high that the stream was called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page939" id="page939"></a>939</span>
Hollow or Hole-bourne, this name surviving in Holborn; and
it was fed by numerous springs (Bagnigge Well, Clerkenwell and
others) in this vicinity. It entered a creek which was navigable
for a considerable distance, and formed a subsidiary harbour
for the City, but by the 14th century this was becoming choked
with refuse, and though an attempt was made to clear it, and
wharves were built in 1670, it was wholly arched over in 1737-1765
below Holborn Bridge. Continuing westward, the most
important stream was Tyburn (<i>q.v.</i>), which rose at Hampstead,
and joined the Thames through branches on either side of
Thorney Island, on which grew up the great ecclesiastical foundation
of St Peter, Westminster, better known as Westminster
Abbey. There is no modern survival of the name of Tyburn,
which finds, indeed, its chief historical interest as attaching to
the famous place of execution which lay near the modern Marble
Arch. The residential district in this vicinity was known at
a later date as Tyburnia. The next stream westward was the
Westbourne, the name of which is perpetuated in Westbourne
Grove and elsewhere in Paddington. It rose on the heights
of Hampstead, traversed Paddington, may be traced in the course
of the Serpentine lake in Hyde Park, ran parallel to and east
of Sloane Street, and joined the Thames close to Chelsea Bridge.
The main tributaries of the Thames from the north, to east and
west of those described, are not covered, nor is any tributary
of importance from the south entirely concealed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;London lies within the geological area known as the
London basin. Within the confines of Greater London the chalk
which forms the basement of this area appears at the surface in
isolated patches about Greenwich, while its main line approaches
within 10 m. of the City to the south and within 15 to the north-west.
In the south and north-west the typical London clay is the principal
formation. In the south-east, however, the Blackheath and Woolwich
pebble-beds appear, with their belts of Thanet sands bordering the
chalk. Valley gravel borders the Thames, with some interruptions,
from Kingston to Greenwich, and extends to a wide belt, with
ramifications, from Wandsworth south to Croydon, and in a narrower
line from Greenwich towards Bromley. Brick earth overlies it from
Kensington to Brentford and west thereof, and appears in Chelsea
and Fulham, Hornsey and Stoke Newington, and in patches south
of the Thames between Battersea and Richmond. The main deposits
of alluvium occur below Lambeth and Westminster, and in the
valley of the Wandle, which joins the Thames from the south near
Putney. In the north and west the clay is interspersed with patches
of plateau gravel in the direction of Finchley (where boulder clay
also appears), Enfield and Barnet; and of Bagshot sands on Hampstead
Heath and Harrow Hill. Gravel is found on the high ground
about Richmond Park and Wimbledon. (See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Middlesex</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is equable (though excessive heat is sometimes
felt for short periods during the summer) and moist, but
healthy. Snow is most common in the early months of the year.
The fogs of London have a peculiar and perhaps an exaggerated
notoriety. They are apt to occur at all seasons, are common from
September to February, and most common in November. The
atmosphere of London is almost invariably misty in a greater or less
degree, but the denser fogs are generally local and of no long duration.
They sometimes cause a serious dislocation of railway and other
traffic. Their principal cause is the smoke from the general domestic
use of coal. The evil is of very long standing, for in 1306 the citizens
petitioned Edward I. to prohibit the use of sea-coal, and he made it a
capital offence. The average temperature of the hottest month,
July, is 64°.4 F.; of the coldest, January, 37°.9; and the mean
annual 50°.4. The mean annual rainfall ranges in different parts of
the metropolis from about 20½ to 27½ in.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center">II. <span class="sc">Topography</span></p>

<p>London as a whole owes nothing in appearance to the natural
configuration of its site. Moreover, the splendid building is
nearly always a unit; seldom, unless accidentally, a component
part of a broad effect. London has not grown up along formal
lines; nor is any large part of it laid out according to the conceptions
of a single generation. Yet not a few of the great thoroughfares
and buildings are individually worthy of London&rsquo;s preeminence
as a city. The most notable of these fall within a
circumscribed area, and it is therefore necessary to preface their
consideration with a statement of the broader characteristic
divisions of the metropolis.</p>

<p><i>Characteristic Divisions.</i>&mdash;In London north of the Thames, the
salient distinction lies between West and East. From the western
boundary of the City proper, an area covering the greater part
of the city of Westminster, and extending into Chelsea, Kensington,
Paddington and Marylebone, is exclusively associated with
the higher-class life of London. Within the bounds of Westminster
are the royal palaces, the government offices and many
other of the finest public buildings, and the wider area specified
includes the majority of the residences of the wealthier classes,
the most beautiful parks and the most fashionable places of
recreation. &ldquo;Mayfair,&rdquo; north of Piccadilly, and &ldquo;Belgravia,&rdquo;
south of Knightsbridge, are common though unofficial names for
the richest residential districts. The &ldquo;City&rdquo; bears in the
great commercial buildings fringing its narrow streets all the
marks of a centre of the world&rsquo;s exchanges. East of it there is
an abrupt transition to the district commonly known as the
&ldquo;East End,&rdquo; as distinguished from the wealthy &ldquo;West End,&rdquo;
a district of mean streets, roughly coincident with the boroughs
of Stepney and Poplar, Shoreditch and Bethnal Green, and
primarily (though by no means exclusively) associated with
the problems attaching to the life of the poor. On the Thames
below London Bridge, London appears in the aspect of one of the
world&rsquo;s great ports, with extensive docks and crowded shipping.
North London is as a whole residential: Hackney, Islington and
St Pancras consist mainly of dwellings of artisans and the
middle classes; while in Hampstead, St Marylebone and Paddington
are many terraces and squares of handsome houses.
Throughout the better residential quarters of London the
number of large blocks of flats has greatly increased in modern
times. But even in the midst of the richest quarters, in Westminster
and elsewhere, small but well-defined areas of the poorest
dwellings occur.</p>

<p>London south of the Thames has none of the grander characteristics
of the wealthy districts to the north. Poor quarters lie
adjacent to the river over the whole distance from Battersea to
Greenwich, merging southward into residential districts of better
class. London has no single well-defined manufacturing quarter.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Suburbs.</i>&mdash;Although the boundary of the county of London does
not, to outward appearance, enclose a city distinct from its suburbs,
London outside that boundary may be conveniently considered as
suburban. Large numbers of business men and others who must of
necessity live in proximity to the metropolis have their homes aloof
from its centre. It is estimated that upwards of a million daily enter
and leave the City alone as the commercial heart of London, and a
great proportion of these travel in and out by the suburban railways.
In this aspect the principal extension of London has been into the
counties of Kent and Surrey, to the pleasant hilly districts about
Sydenham, Norwood and Croydon, Chislehurst and Orpington,
Caterham, Redhill and Reigate, Epsom, Dorking and Leatherhead;
and up the valley of the Thames through Richmond to Kingston and
Surbiton, Esher and Weybridge, and the many townships on both
the Surrey and the Middlesex shores of the river. On the west and
north the residential suburbs immediately outside the county include
Acton and Ealing, Willesden, Highgate, Finchley and Hornsey;
from the last two a densely populated district extends north through
Wood Green and Southgate to Barnet and Enfield; while the
&ldquo;residential influence&rdquo; of the metropolis far exceeds these limits,
and may be observed at Harrow and Pinner, Bushey and Boxmoor,
St Albans, Harpenden, Stevenage and many other places. To the
north-east the beauty of Epping Forest attracts numerous residents
to Woodford, Chingford and Loughton. The valley of the Lea is also
thickly populated, but chiefly by an industrial population working
in the numerous factories along this river. The Lea separates the
county of London from Essex, but the townships of West Ham and
Stratford, Barking and Ilford, Leyton and Walthamstow continue
the metropolis in this direction almost without a break. Their
population is also largely occupied in local manufacturing establishments;
while numerous towns on either bank of the lower Thames
share in the industries of the port of London.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Streets.</i>&mdash;The principal continuous thoroughfares within the
metropolis, though each bears a succession of names, are coincident
with the main roads converging upon the capital from all
parts of England. On the north of the Thames two great
thoroughfares from the west meet in the heart of the City.
The northern enters the county in Hammersmith as Uxbridge
Road, crosses Kensington and borders the north side of Kensington
Gardens and Hyde Park as Bayswater Road. It then
bears successively the names of Oxford Street, New Oxford
Street and High Holborn; enters the City, becomes known as
Holborn Viaduct from the fact that it is there carried over other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page940" id="page940"></a>940</span>
streets which lie at a lower level, and then as Newgate Street
and Cheapside. The southern highway enters Hammersmith,
crosses the centre of Kensington as Kensington Road and High
Street, borders Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park as Kensington
Gore and Knightsbridge, with terraces of fine residences,
and merges into Piccadilly. This beautiful street, with its
northward branches, Park Lane, from which splendid houses
overlook Hyde Park, and Bond Street, lined with handsome
shops, may be said to focus the fashionable life of London.
The direct line of the thoroughfare is interrupted after Piccadilly
Circus (the term &ldquo;circus&rdquo; is frequently applied to the open
space&mdash;not necessarily round&mdash;at the junction of several roads),
but is practically resumed in the Strand, with its hotels, shops and
numerous theatres, and continued through the City in Fleet
Street, the centre of the newspaper world, and Ludgate Hill,
at the head of which is St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. Thence it runs by
commercial Cannon Street to the junction with Cheapside and
several other busy streets. At this junction stand the Royal
Exchange, the Mansion House (the official residence of the Lord
Mayor of London) and the Bank of England, from which this
important point in the communications of London is commonly
known as &ldquo;Bank.&rdquo; From the east two main roads similarly
converge upon the City, which they enter by Aldgate (the
suffix in this and other names indicating the former existence
of one of the City gates). The southern of these highways,
approaching through the eastern suburbs as Barking Road,
becomes East India Docks Road in Poplar and Commercial
Road East in Stepney. The continuous thoroughfare of 12 m.
between Hammersmith and the East India Docks illustrates
successively every phase of London life. The northern road
enters from Stratford and is called Bow Road, Mile End Road,
Whitechapel Road and High Street, Whitechapel. From the
north of England two roads preserve communication-lines from
the earliest times. The Old North Road, entering London from
the Lea valley through Hackney and Shoreditch as Stamford
Hill, Stoke Newington Road and Kingsland Road, reaches the
City by Bishopsgate. The straight highway from the north-west
which as Edgware Road joins Oxford Street at the Marble
Arch (the north-eastern entrance to Hyde Park) is coincident
with the Roman Watling Street. The Holyhead and Great North
Roads, uniting at Barnet, enter London by branches through
Hampstead and through Highgate, between the Old North and
Edgware roads. South of the Thames the thoroughfares crossing
the river between Lambeth and Bermondsey converge upon two
circuses, St George&rsquo;s and the Elephant and Castle. At the second
of these points the majority of the chief roads from the southern
suburbs and the south of England are collected. Among them,
the Old Kent Road continues the southern section of Watling
Street, from Dover and the south-east, through Woolwich and
across Blackheath. The road through Streatham, Brixton and
Kennington, taking name from these districts successively, is
the principal southern highway. The Portsmouth Road from
the south-west is well marked as far as Lambeth, under the names
of Wandsworth, High Street, St John&rsquo;s Hill, Lavender Hill and
Wandsworth Road.</p>

<p><i>Thames Embankments.</i>&mdash;The Thames follows a devious course
through London, and the fine embankments on its north side,
nowhere continuing uninterruptedly for more than 2 m., do not
form important thoroughfares, with the exception of the Victoria
Embankment. Mostly they serve rather as beautiful promenades.
One of them begins over against Battersea Bridge. Its
finest portion is the Chelsea Embankment, fronting Battersea
Park across the river, shaded by a pleasant avenue and lined
with handsome houses. It continues, with some interruptions,
nearly as far as the Houses of Parliament. Below these the
grandest of the embankments extends to the City at Blackfriars.
It was formed in 1864-1870, and is named the Victoria Embankment,
though its popular title is &ldquo;The Embankment&rdquo; simply.
Open gardens fringe it in part on the landward side, and it is
lined with fine public and private buildings. The bold sweep of
the Thames, here some 300 yds. wide, the towers of Westminster
on the one hand and the dome of St Paul&rsquo;s on the other, make
up a fine prospect. Below London Bridge the river is embanked
for a short distance in front of the Tower of London, and above
Westminster Bridge the Albert Embankment extends for nearly
1 m. along the south bank.</p>

<p><i>Bridges.</i>&mdash;Fourteen road-bridges cross the Thames within the
county of London. Of these London Bridge, connecting the City
with Southwark and Bermondsey, stands first in historical
interest and in importance as a modern highway. The old
bridge, famous for many generations, bearing its rows of houses
and its chapel in the centre, was completed early in the 13th
century. It was 308 yds. long and had twenty narrow arches,
through which the tides formed dangerous rapids. It stood just
below the existing bridge, which was built of granite by John
Rennie and his son Sir John Rennie, and completed in 1831. A
widening to accommodate the growth of traffic, after being
frequently discussed for many years, was completed in 1904,
by means of corbels projecting on either side, without arresting
traffic during the work. There was no bridge over the Thames
below London Bridge until 1894, when the Tower Bridge was
opened. This is a suspension bridge with a central portion,
between two lofty and massive stone towers, consisting of
bascules which can be raised by hydraulic machinery to admit
the passage of vessels. The bridge is both a remarkable engineering
work, and architecturally one of the finest modern structures
in London. The bridges in order above London Bridge are as
follows, railway-bridges being bracketed&mdash;Southwark, (Cannon
Street), (Blackfriars), Blackfriars, Waterloo, (Hungerford&mdash;with
a footway), Westminster, Lambeth, Vauxhall, (Grosvenor),
Victoria, Albert, Battersea, (Battersea), Wandsworth, (Putney),
Putney and Hammersmith. Waterloo Bridge, the oldest now
standing within London, is the work of John Rennie, and was
opened in 1817. It is a massive stone structure of nine arches,
carrying a level roadway, and is considered one of the finest
bridges of its kind in the world. The present Westminster
Bridge, of iron on granite piers, was opened in 1862, but another
preceded it, dating from 1750; the view from which was
appreciated by Wordsworth in his sonnet beginning &ldquo;Earth has
not anything to show more fair.&rdquo; The complete reconstruction
of Vauxhall Bridge was undertaken in 1902, and the new bridge
was opened in 1906. Some of the bridges were built by companies,
and tolls were levied at their crossing until modern times; thus
Southwark Bridge was made toll-free in 1866, and Waterloo
Bridge only in 1878, on being acquired by the City Corporation
and the Metropolitan Board of Works respectively. The road-bridges
mentioned (except the City bridges) are maintained by
the London County Council, who expended for this purpose a
sum of £9149 in 1907-1908. The following table shows the
capital expenditure on the more important bridges and their

<p class="noind">The properties entrusted to the Corporation for the upkeep of
London Bridge are managed by the Bridge House Estates
Committee, the revenues from which are also used in the maintenance
of the other three City bridges, £26,989 being thus
expended in 1907, the Tower bridge absorbing £17,735 of this
amount.</p>

<p><i>Thames Tunnels.</i>&mdash;Some of the metropolitan railway lines
cross the river in tunnels beneath its bed. There are also
several tunnels under the river below London Bridge, namely:
Tower Subway, constructed in 1870 for foot-passengers, but
no longer used, Greenwich Tunnel (1902) for foot-passengers,
Blackwall Tunnel (1897), constructed by the County Council
between Greenwich and Poplar, and Woolwich Tunnel, begun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page941" id="page941"></a>941</span>
in 1910. A tunnel between Rotherhithe and Ratcliff was
authorized in 1897 and opened in 1908. The Thames Tunnel
(1825-1843), 2 m. below London Bridge, became a railway
tunnel in 1865. The County Council maintains a free ferry
at Woolwich for passengers and vehicular traffic. The capital
expenditure on this undertaking was £185,337 and the expense
of maintenance in 1907-1908 £20,881. The Greenwich Tunnel
(capital expenditure £179,293) in the same year had expended on
it for maintenance £3725, and the Blackwall Tunnel (capital
expenditure £1,268,951) £11,420. The capital expenditure on
the Rotherhithe Tunnel was £1,414,561.</p>

<p><i>Parks.</i>&mdash;The administration and acreage of parks and open
spaces, and their provisions for the public recreation, fall for
consideration later, but some of them are notable features in the
topography of London. The royal parks, namely St James&rsquo;s,
Green and Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens, stretch in an
irregular belt for nearly 3 m. between Whitehall (Westminster)
and Kensington. St James&rsquo;s Park was transformed from marshy
land into a deer park, bowling green and tennis court by Henry
VIII., extended and laid out as a pleasure garden by Charles II.,
and rearranged according to the designs of John Nash in 1827-1829.
Its lake, the broad Mall leading up to Buckingham
Palace, and the proximity of the government buildings in
Whitehall, combine to beautify it. Here was established, by
licence from James I., the so-called Milk Fair, which remained,
its ownership always in the same family, until 1905, when, on
alterations being made to the Mall, a new stall was erected for
the owners during their lifetime, though the cow or cows kept
here were no longer allowed. St James&rsquo;s Park is continued
between the Mall and Piccadilly by the Green Park. Hyde Park,
to the west, belonged originally to the manor of Hyde, which
was attached to Westminster Abbey, but was taken by Henry
VIII. on the dissolution of the monasteries. Two of its gateways
are noteworthy, namely that at Hyde Park Corner at the south-east
and the Marble Arch at the north-east. The first was built
in 1828 from designs of Decimus Burton, and comprises three
arches with a frieze above the central arch copied from the Elgin
marbles in the British Museum. The Marble Arch was intended
as a monument to Nelson, and first stood in front of Buckingham
Palace, being moved to its present site in 1851. It no longer
forms an entrance to the park, as in 1908 a corner of the park
was cut off and a roadway was formed to give additional accommodation
for the heavy traffic between Oxford Street, Edgware
Road and Park Lane. The Marble Arch was thus left isolated.
Hyde Park contains the Serpentine, a lake 1500 yds. in length,
from the bridge over which one of the finest prospects in London
is seen, extending to the distant towers of Westminster. Since
the 17th century this park has been one of the most favoured
resorts of fashionable society, and at the height of the &ldquo;season,&rdquo;
from May to the end of July, its drives present a brilliant scene.
In the 17th and 18th centuries it was a favourite duelling-ground,
and in the present day it is not infrequently the scene
of political and other popular demonstrations (as is also Trafalgar
Square), while the neighbourhood of Marble Arch is the constant
resort of orators on social and religious topics. Kensington
Gardens, originally attached to Kensington Palace, were subsequently
much extended; they are magnificently timbered,
and contain plantations of rare shrubs and flowering trees.
Regent&rsquo;s Park, mainly in the borough of Marylebone, owes its
preservation to the intention of George III. to build a palace
here. The other most notable open spaces wholly or partly
within the county are Hampstead Heath in the north-west, a
wild, high-lying tract preserved to a great extent in its natural
state, and in the south-west Wimbledon Common, Putney Heath
and the royal demesne of Richmond Park, which from its higher
parts commands a wonderful view up the rich valley of the
Thames. The outlying parts of the county to east, south and
north are not lacking in open spaces, but there is an extensive
inner area where at most only small gardens and squares break
the continuity of buildings, and where in some cases old churchyards
serve as public grounds.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Architecture.</i>&mdash;While stone is the material used in the construction
of the majority of great buildings of London, some modern examples
(notably the Westminster Roman Catholic cathedral) are of red brick
with stone dressings; and brick is in commonest use for general
domestic building. The smoke-laden atmosphere has been found not
infrequently to exercise a deleterious effect upon the stonework of
important buildings; and through the same cause the appearance of
London as a whole is by some condemned as sombre. Bright colour,
in truth, is wanting, though attempts are made in a few important
modern erections to supply it, a notable instance being the Savoy
Hotel buildings (1904) in the Strand. Portland stone is frequently
employed in the larger buildings, as in St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and under
the various influences of weather and atmosphere acquires strongly
contrasting tones of light grey and black. Owing to the by-laws of
the County Council, the method of raising commercial or residential
buildings to an extreme height is not practised in London; the
block known as Queen Anne&rsquo;s Mansions, Westminster, is an exception,
though it cannot be called high in comparison with American
high buildings.</p>

<p>Architectural remains of earlier date than the Norman period are
very few, and of historical rather than topographical importance.
In architecture of the Norman and Gothic periods London
must be considered rich, though its richness is poverty
<span class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical architecture.</span>
when its losses, particularly during the great fire of 1666,
are recalled. These losses were confined within the City,
but, to go no farther, included the Norman and Gothic
cathedral of St Paul, perhaps a nobler monument of its period than
any which has survived it, much as it had suffered from injudicious
restoration. Ancient architecture in London is principally ecclesiastical.
Westminster Abbey is pre-eminent; in part, it may be,
owing to the reverence felt towards it in preference to the classical
St Paul&rsquo;s by those whose ideal of a cathedral church is essentially
Gothic, but mainly from the fact that it is the burial-place of many of
the English monarchs and their greatest subjects, as well as the
scene of their coronations (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Westminster</a></span>). In the survey of
London (1598) by John Stow, 125 churches, including St Paul&rsquo;s and
Westminster Abbey, are named; of these 89 were destroyed by the
great fire. Thirteen large conventual churches were mentioned by
Fitzstephen in the time of Henry II., and of these there are some
remains.</p>

<p>The church of St Bartholomew the Great, Smithfield, is the finest
remnant of its period in London. It was founded in 1123 by Rahere,
who, probably a Breton by birth, was a courtier in the reign of
William II. He is said to have been the king&rsquo;s minstrel, and to
have spent the earlier part of his life in frivolity. Subsequently he
entered holy orders, and in <i>c.</i> 1120, being stricken with fever while on
a pilgrimage to Rome, vowed that he would found a hospital in
London. St Bartholomew, appearing to him in a vision, bade him
add a church to his foundation. He became an Augustinian canon,
and founded his hospital, which is now, as St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital,
one of the principal medical institutions in the metropolis. He became
its first master. Later he erected the priory, for canons of his
order, of which the nave and transepts of the church remain. The
work is in the main very fine Norman, with triforium, ambulatory
and apsidal eastern end. An eastern lady chapel dates from <i>c.</i> 1410,
but the upper part is modern, for the chapel was long desecrated.
There are remains of the cloisters north of the church,&mdash;and praiseworthy
efforts have been made since 1903 towards their restoration.
The western limit of the former nave of the church is marked by a fine
Early English doorway, now forming an entrance to the churchyard.
Rahere&rsquo;s tomb remains in the church; the canopy is Perpendicular
work, but the effigy is believed to be original. He died in 1144.</p>

<p>The Temple Church (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Inns of Court</a></span>), serving for the Inner and
Middle Temples, belonged to the Knights Templars. It is the finest
of the four ancient round churches in England, dating from 1185,
but an Early English choir opens from the round church. St
Saviour&rsquo;s in Southwark (<i>q.v.</i>), the cathedral church of the modern
bishopric of Southwark, was the church of the priory of St Mary
Overy, and is a large cruciform building mainly Early English in
style. There may be mentioned also an early pier in the church of
St Katherine Cree or Christ Church, Leadenhall Street, belonging to
the priory church of the Holy Trinity; old monuments in the vaults
beneath St James&rsquo;s Church, Clerkenwell, formerly attached to a
Benedictine nunnery; and the Perpendicular gateway and the crypt
of the church of the priory of St John of Jerusalem (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Finsbury</a></span>).
Among other ancient churches within the City, that of All Hallows
Barking, near the Tower of London, is principally Perpendicular and
contains some fine brasses. It belonged to the convent at Barking,
Essex, and was the burial-place of many who were executed at the
scaffold on Tower Hill. St Andrew Undershaft, so named because a
Maypole used to be set up before the former church on May-day, is
late Perpendicular (<i>c.</i> 1530); and contains a monument to John
Stow the chronicler (d. 1605). The church of Austin Friars, originally
belonging to a friary founded in 1253, became a Dutch church
under a grant of Edward VI., and still remains so; its style is
principally Decorated, but through various vicissitudes little of the
original work is left. St Giles, Cripplegate, was founded <i>c.</i> 1090,
but the existing church is late Perpendicular. It is the burial-place
of Fox the martyrologist and Milton the poet, and contains some
fine wood-carving by Grinling Gibbons. St Helen&rsquo;s, Bishopsgate,
belonged to a priory of nuns founded <i>c.</i> 1212, but the greater part of
the building is later. It has two naves parallel, originally for the use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page942" id="page942"></a>942</span>
of the nuns and the parishioners respectively. The church of St
Mary-le-Bow, in Cheapside, is built upon a Norman crypt, and that
of St Olave&rsquo;s, Hart Street, which was Pepys&rsquo;s church and contains a
modern memorial to him, is of the 15th century. Other ancient
churches outside the City are few; but there may be noted St
Margaret&rsquo;s, under the shadow of Westminster Abbey; and the
beautiful Ely Chapel in Holborn (<i>q.v.</i>), the only remnant of a palace
of the bishops of Ely, now used by the Roman Catholics. The
Chapel Royal, Savoy, near the Strand, was rebuilt by Henry VII.
on the site of Savoy Palace, which was erected by Peter, earl of
Savoy and Richmond, in 1245, and destroyed in the insurrection of
Wat Tyler in 1381. In 1505 Henry VII. endowed here a hospital of
St John the Baptist for the poor. The chapel was used as the parish
church of St Mary-le-Strand (1564-1717) and constituted a Chapel
Royal in 1773; but there are no remains of the rest of the
foundation.</p>

<p>The architect to whom, after the great fire of 1666, the opportunity
fell of leaving the marks of his influence upon London was Sir
Christopher Wren. Had all his schemes been followed out,
that influence would have extended beyond architecture
<span class="sidenote">Sir Christopher Wren.</span>
alone. He, among others, prepared designs for laying
out the City anew. But no such model city was destined
to be built; the necessity for haste and the jealous guardianship of
rights to old foundations resulted in the old lines being generally
followed. It is characteristic of London that St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
(<i>q.v.</i>) should be closely hemmed in by houses, and its majestic west
front approached obliquely by a winding thoroughfare. The cathedral
is Wren&rsquo;s crowning work. It is the scene from time to time of
splendid ceremonies, and contains the tombs of many great men;
but in this respect it cannot compete with the peculiar associations of
Westminster Abbey. Of Wren&rsquo;s other churches it is to be noted that
the necessity of economy usually led him to pay special attention to
a single feature. He generally chose the steeple, and there are many
fine examples of his work in this department. The steeple of St
Mary-le-Bow, commonly called Bow Church, is one of the most noteworthy.
This church has various points of interest besides its Norman
crypt, from which it took the name of Bow, being the first church in
London built on arches. The ecclesiastical Court of Arches sat here
formerly. &ldquo;Bow bells&rdquo; are famous, and any person born within
hearing of them is said to be a &ldquo;Cockney,&rdquo; a term now applied
particularly to the dialect of the lower classes in London. Wren
occasionally followed the Gothic model, as in St Antholin. The
<span class="sidenote">Later churches.</span>
classic style, however, was generally adopted in the period
succeeding his own. Some fine churches belong to this
period, such as St Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields (1726), the
Corinthian portico of which rises on the upper part of Trafalgar
Square; but other examples are regrettable. While the architecture
of the City churches, with the exceptions mentioned, is not as a rule
remarkable, many are notable for the rich and beautiful wood-carving
they contain. A Gothic style has been most commonly
adopted in building modern churches; but of these the most notable,
the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Westminster</a></span>), is
Byzantine, and built principally of brick, with a lofty campanile.
The only other ecclesiastical building to be specially mentioned is
Lambeth Palace, opposite to the Houses of Parliament across the
Thames. It has been a seat of the archbishops of Canterbury since
1197, and though the present residential portion dates only from the
early 19th century, the chapel, hall and other parts are of the 13th
century and later (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lambeth</a></span>).</p>

<p>Among secular buildings, there is none more venerable than the
Tower of London (<i>q.v.</i>), the moated fortress which overlooks the
<span class="sidenote">Tower of London.</span>
Thames at the eastern boundary of the City. It presents
fine examples of Norman architecture; its historical
associations are of the highest interest, and its armoury
and the regalia of England, which are kept here, attract great
numbers of visitors.</p>

<p>The Houses of Parliament, with Westminster Abbey and St
Margaret&rsquo;s Church, complete the finest group of buildings which
London possesses; a group essentially Gothic, for the
Houses of Parliament, completed in 1867 from the designs
<span class="sidenote">Government buildings.</span>
of Barry, are in a late Perpendicular style. They cover a
great area, the east front giving immediately upon the
Thames. The principal external features are the huge Victoria
Tower at the south, and the clock tower, with its well-known chimes
and the hour-bell &ldquo;Big Ben,&rdquo; on the north. Some of the apartments
are magnificently adorned within, and the building incorporates the
ancient Westminster Hall, belonging to the former royal palace on the
site (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Westminster</a></span>). The government offices are principally in
Whitehall, the fine thoroughfare which connects Parliament Square,
in the angle between the Houses and the Abbey, with Trafalgar
Square. Somerset House (1776-1786), a massive range of buildings
by Sir William Chambers, surrounding a quadrangle, and having its
front upon the Strand and back upon the Victoria Embankment,
occupies the site of a palace founded by the protector Somerset,
c. 1548. It contains the Exchequer and Audit, Inland Revenue,
Probate, Registrar-General&rsquo;s and other offices, and one wing
houses King&rsquo;s College. Other offices are the New Record Office, the
repository of State papers and other records, and the Patent Office
in Chancery Lane. The Heralds&rsquo; College or College of Arms, the
official authority in matters of armorial bearings and pedigrees,
occupies a building in Queen Victoria Street, City, erected subsequently
to the great fire (1683). The Royal Courts of Justice or
Law Courts stand adjacent to the Inns of Court, facing the Strand at
the point where a memorial marks the site of Old Temple Bar (1672),
at the entrance to the City, removed in 1878 and later re-erected at
Theobald&rsquo;s Park, near Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The Law Courts
(1882) were erected from the designs of G. E. Street, in a Gothic
style.</p>

<p>The buildings connected with local government in London are with
one exception modern, and handsome town-halls have been erected
for some of the boroughs. The exception is the Guildhall (<i>q.v.</i>) of
the City Corporation, with its splendid hall, the scene of meetings
and entertainments of the corporation, its council chamber, library
and crypt (partly opened to the public in 1910). In 1906 the London
County Council obtained parliamentary sanction for the erection of
a county hall on the south bank of the Thames, immediately east
of Westminster Bridge, and in 1908 a design submitted by Mr Ralph
Knott was accepted in competition. The style prescribed was English
Renaissance. Several of the great livery companies or gilds of the
City possess fine halls, containing portraits and other collections of high
interest and value. Among the more notable of these halls are those
of the Mercers, Drapers, Fishmongers, Clothworkers, Armourers and
Stationers.</p>

<p>The former royal palaces of Westminster and of Whitehall, of
which the fine Jacobean banqueting hall remains, are described under
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Westminster</a></span>. The present London residence of the
sovereign is Buckingham Palace, on the west side of St
<span class="sidenote">Royal palaces.</span>
James&rsquo;s Park, with beautiful gardens behind it. Buckingham
House was built in 1705 for the duke of Buckinghamshire, and
purchased by George III. in 1762. The existing palace was finished
by John Nash in 1835, but did not meet with approval, and was
considerably altered before Queen Victoria occupied it in 1837. As
regards its exterior appearance it is one of the least satisfactory of
London&rsquo;s great buildings, though the throne room and other state
apartments are magnificent within. The picture gallery contains
valuable works of Dutch masters and others. The front of the
palace forms the background to the public memorial to Queen
Victoria, at the head of the Mall. Provision was made in the design,
by Sir Aston Webb, for the extension of the Mall to open upon
Trafalgar Square, through gateways in a semicircular range of
buildings to be occupied by government offices, and for a wide
circular space in front of the Palace, with a statue of the Queen by
Thomas Brock in its centre. St James&rsquo;s Palace, at the north side of
St James&rsquo;s Park, was acquired and rebuilt by Henry VIII., having
been formerly a hospital founded in the 12th century for leprous
maidens. It was the royal residence after the destruction of Whitehall
by fire in the time of William III. until a fire in 1809 destroyed
the greater part. Only the gateway and certain apartments remain
of the Tudor building. Marlborough House, adjacent to the palace,
was built by the first duke of Marlborough in 1710 from the designs
of Wren, came into possession of the Crown in 1817, and has been
occupied since 1863 by the prince of Wales. In Kensington (<i>q.v.</i>), on
the west side of Kensington Gardens, is the palace acquired by
William III. as a country seat, and though no longer used by the
sovereign, is in part occupied by members of the royal family, and
possesses a deeper historical interest than the other royal palaces, as
the birthplace of Queen Victoria and her residence in youth.</p>

<p>There are few survivals of ancient domestic architecture in London,
but the gabled and timbered front of Staple Inn, Holborn (<i>q.v.</i>) is a
picturesque fragment. In Bishopsgate Street, City, stood Crosby Hall,
which belonged to Crosby Place, the mansion of Sir John Crosby
(d. 1475). Richard III. occupied the mansion as duke of Gloucester
and Lord Protector (cf. Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Richard III.</i>, Act i. Sc. 3, &amp;c.)
The hall was removed in 1908, in spite of strong efforts to preserve
it, which resulted in its re-erection on a site in Chelsea. The hall of
the Middle Temple is an admirable example of a refectory of later
date (1572).</p>

<p>A fine though circumscribed group of buildings is that in the heart
of the City which includes the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange
and the Mansion House. The Bank is a characteristic building,
quadrilateral, massive and low, but covering a large area, without
external windows, and almost wholly unadorned; though the north-west
corner is copied from the Temple of the Sibyl at Tivoli. The
building is mainly the work of Sir John Soane (<i>c.</i> 1788). The first
building for the Royal Exchange was erected and presented to the
City by Sir Thomas Gresham (1565-1570) whose crest, a grasshopper,
appears in the wind-vane above the present building.
Gresham&rsquo;s Exchange was destroyed in the great fire of 1666; and
the subsequent building was similarly destroyed in 1838. The
present building has an imposing Corinthian portico, and encloses a
court surrounded by an ambulatory adorned with historical paintings
by Leighton, Seymour Lucas, Stanhope Forbes and others. The
Mansion House was erected <i>c.</i> 1740.</p>

<p>The only other public buildings, beyond those at Westminster,
which fall into a great group are the modern museums, the Imperial
Institute, London University and other institutions, and Albert Hall,
which lie between Kensington Gore and Brompton and Cromwell
Roads, and these, together with the National Gallery (in Trafalgar
Square) and other art galleries, and the principal scientific, educational
and recreative institutions, are considered in Section V.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page943" id="page943"></a>943</span></p>

<p><i>Monuments and Memorials.</i>&mdash;The Monument (1677), Fish Street
Hill, City, erected from the designs of Wren in commemoration of the
great fire of 1666, is a Doric column surmounted by a gilt representation
of a flaming urn. The Nelson Column, the central feature of
Trafalgar Square, is from the designs of William Railton (1843),
crowned with a statue of Nelson by Baily, and has at its base four
colossal lions in bronze, modelled by Sir Edwin Landseer. A statue
of the duke of Cambridge, by Captain Adrian Jones, was unveiled
in 1907 in front of the War Office, Whitehall. The duke of York&rsquo;s
Column, Carlton House Terrace (1833), an Ionic pillar, is surmounted
by a bronze statue by Sir Richard Westmacott. The Westminster
Column, outside the entrance to Dean&rsquo;s Yard, was erected to the
memory of the old pupils of Westminster School who died in the
Russian and Indian wars of 1854-1859. The Guards Memorial,
Waterloo Place, commemorates the foot guards who died in the
Crimea. The Albert Memorial, Kensington Gardens, was erected
(1872) by &ldquo;Queen Victoria and her People to the memory of Albert,
Prince Consort,&rdquo; from the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott, with a statue
of the Prince (1876) by John Henry Foley beneath a huge ornate Gothic
canopy. At the eastern end of the Strand a memorial with statue by
Hamo Thorneycroft of William Ewart Gladstone was unveiled in
1905. In Parliament Square and elsewhere are numerous statues,
some of high merit, but it cannot be said that statuary occupies an
important place in the adornment of streets and open places in
London. Cleopatra&rsquo;s Needle, an ancient Egyptian monument, was
presented to the government by Mehemet Ali in 1819, brought from
Alexandria in 1878, and erected on the Victoria embankment on a
pedestal of grey granite.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Nomenclature.</i>&mdash;Having regard to the destruction of visible
evidences of antiquity in London, both through accidental
agencies such as the great fire, and through inevitable modernizing
influences, it is well that historical associations in nomenclature
are preserved in a great measure unimpaired. The City
naturally offers the richest field for study in this direction.
The derivations of names may here be grouped into two classes,
those having a commercial connexion, and those associated
with ancient buildings, particularly the City wall and ecclesiastical
foundations. Among examples of the first group, Cheapside
is prominent. This modern thoroughfare of shops was in early
times the Chepe (O. Eng. <i>ceap</i>, bargain), an open place occupied
by a market, having, until the 14th century, a space set apart
for popular entertainments. There was a Queen Eleanor cross
here, and conduits supplied the city with water. Modern
Cheapside merges eastward into the street called the Poultry,
from the poulterers&rsquo; stalls &ldquo;but lately departed from thence,&rdquo;
according to Stow, at the close of the 16th century. Cornhill,
again, recalls the cornmarket &ldquo;time out of mind there holden&rdquo;
(Stow), and Gracechurch Street was corrupted from the name of
the church of St Benet Grasschurch (destroyed by the great fire,
rebuilt, and removed in 1868), which was said to be derived from
a herb-market held under its walls. The Jews had their quarter
near the commercial centre, their presence being indicated by
the street named Old Jewry, though it is probable that they
did not reoccupy this locality after their expulsion in 1290.
Lombard Street similarly points to the residence of Lombard
merchants, the name existing when Edward II. confirmed a
grant to Florentine merchants in 1318, while the Lombards
maintained their position until Tudor times. Paternoster Row,
still occupied by booksellers, takes name from the sellers of
prayer-books and writers of texts who collected under the
shadow of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. As regards names derived from
ancient buildings, instances are the streets called London Wall
and Barbican, and those named after the numerous gates. Of
those associated with ecclesiastical foundations several occur in
the course of this article (Section II., <i>Ecclesiastical Architecture</i>,
&amp;c.). Such are Austin Friars, Crutched Friars, Blackfriars and
Whitefriars. To this last district a curious alternative name,
Alsatia, was given, probably in the 17th century, with reference
to its notoriety as a hiding-place of debtors. A derivation is
suggested from the disputed territory of Alsace, pointing the
contrast between this lawless district and the adjacent Temple,
the home of the law itself. The name Bridewell came from a
well near the Fleet (New Bridge Street), dedicated to St Bride,
and was attached to a house built by Henry VIII. (1522), but
is most familiar in its application to the house of correction
instituted by Edward VI., which remained a prison till 1863.
The Minories, a street leading south from Aldgate, takes name
from an abbey of nuns of St Clare (<i>Sorores Minores</i>) founded
in 1293. Apart from the City an interesting ecclesiastical
survival is the name Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, recalling
the place of sanctuary which long survived the monastery under
the protection of which it originally existed. Covent Garden,
again, took its name from a convent garden belonging to
Westminster. Among the survivals of names of non-ecclesiastical
buildings Castle Baynard may be noted; it stood in the City
on the banks of the Thames, and was held by Ralph Baynard, a
Norman, in the time of william the Conqueror; a later building
being erected in 1428 by Humphrey duke of Gloucester. Here
Richard III. was acclaimed king, and the mansion was used
by Henry VII. and Henry VIII. Its name is kept in a wharf
and a ward of the City.</p>

<p>The survival of names of obliterated physical features or
characteristics is illustrated in Section I.; but additional
instances are found in the Strand, which originally ran close to
the sloping bank of the Thames, and in Smithfield, now the
central meat market, but for long the &ldquo;smooth field&rdquo; where a
cattle and hay market was held, and the scene of tournaments
and games, and also of executions. Here in 1381 Wat Tyler
the rebel was killed by Sir William Walworth during the parley
with Richard II. In the West End of London the majority of
important street-names are naturally of a later derivation than
those in the ancient City, though Charing Cross (<i>q.v.</i>) is an
instance of an exception. The derivation commonly accepted
for Piccadilly is from <i>pickadil</i>, a stiff collar or hem in fashion in
the early part of the 17th century (Span. <i>picca</i>, a spear-head).
In Pall Mall and the neighbouring Mall in St James&rsquo; Park is
found the title of a game resembling croquet (Fr. <i>paille maille</i>)
in favour at or before the time of Charles I., though the Mall
was laid out for the game by Charles II. Other names pointing
to the existence of pastimes now extinct are found elsewhere
in London, as in Balls Pond Road, Islington, where in the 17th
century was a proprietary pond for the sport of duck-hunting.
An entertainment of another form is recalled in the name of
Spring Gardens, St James&rsquo; Park, where at the time of James I.
there was a fountain or spring so arranged as to besprinkle those
who trod unwarily on the valve which opened it. Many of the
names of the rich residential streets and squares in the west
have associations with the various owners of the properties;
but Mayfair is so called from a fair held on this ground in May
as early as the reign of Charles II. Finally there are several
survivals, in street-names, of former private mansions and other
buildings. Thus the district of the Adelphi, south of Charing
Cross, takes name from the block of dwellings and offices erected
in 1768 by the brothers (Gr. <i>adelphi</i>) Robert and William Adam,
Scottish architects. In Piccadilly Clarendon House, erected in
1664 by Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, became Albemarle
House when acquired by the duke of Albemarle in 1675.
Northumberland House, from which is named Northumberland
Avenue, opening upon Trafalgar Square, was built <i>c.</i> 1605 by
Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, and was acquired by
marriage by Algernon Percy, earl of Northumberland, in 1642.
It took name from this family, and stood until 1874. Arundel
House, originally a seat of the bishops of Bath, was the residence
of Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, whose famous collection
of sculpture, the Arundel Marbles, was housed here until presented
to Oxford University in 1667. The site of the house is
marked by Arundel Street, Strand.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">III. <span class="sc">Communications</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Railways.</i>&mdash;The trunk railways leaving London, with their
termini, are as follows: (1) <i>Northern</i>. The Great Northern, Midland
and London &amp; North-Western systems have adjacent termini,
namely King&rsquo;s Cross, St Pancras and Euston, in Euston Road, St
Pancras. The terminus of the Great Central railway is Marylebone,
in the road of that name. (2) <i>Western</i>. The terminus of the Great
Western railway is Paddington (Praed Street); and that of the
London &amp; South-Western, Waterloo, south of the Thames in Lambeth.
(3) <i>Southern.</i> The London, Brighton &amp; South Coast railway has
its western terminus at Victoria, and its central terminus at London
Bridge, on the south side of the Thames. The South-Eastern &amp;
Chatham railway has four terminal stations, all on or close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page944" id="page944"></a>944</span>
north bank of the river&mdash;Victoria, Charing Cross,<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Holborn Viaduct
and Cannon Street (City). St Paul&rsquo;s Station on the Holborn branch
is also terminal in part. (4) <i>Eastern.</i> The principal terminus of the
Great Eastern Railway is in Liverpool Street (City), but the company
also uses Fenchurch Street (City), the terminus of the London,
Tilbury &amp; Southend railway, and St Pancras. These lines,
especially the southern lines, the Great Eastern, Great Northern and
South-Western carry a very heavy suburban traffic. Systems of
joint lines and running powers are maintained to afford communication
between the main lines. Thus the West London Extension line
carries local traffic between the North Western and Great Western
and the Brighton and South-Western systems, while the Metropolitan
Extension through the City connects the Midland and Great Northern
with the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham lines.</p>

<p>The railways whose systems are mainly or wholly confined within
the metropolitan area are as follows. The North London railway
has a terminal station at Broad Street, City, and serves the parts of
London implied by its name. The company possesses running powers
over the lines of various other companies: thus its trains run as far
north as Potter&rsquo;s Bar on the Great Northern line, while it serves
Richmond on the west and Poplar on the east. The East London
line connects Shoreditch with New Cross (Deptford) by way of the
Thames Tunnel, a subway under the river originally built for foot-passengers.
The London &amp; India Docks line connects the city
with the docks on the north bank of the river as far as North
Woolwich. The Metropolitan railway has a line from Baker Street
through north-west London to Harrow, continuing to Uxbridge,
while the original main line runs on to Rickmansworth, Aylesbury
and Verney Junction, but has been worked by the Metropolitan and
Great Central companies jointly since 1906. Another line serves the
western outskirts (Hammersmith, Richmond, &amp;c.) from the city.
Metropolitan trains also connect at New Cross with the south-eastern
railway system. This company combines with the Metropolitan
District to form the Inner Circle line, which has stations close
to all the great railway termini north of the Thames. The Metropolitan
District (commonly called the District) system serves
Wimbledon, Richmond, Ealing and Harrow on the west, and passes
eastward by Earl&rsquo;s Court, South Kensington, Victoria and Mansion
House (City) to Whitechapel and Bow. The Metropolitan and the
District lines within London are for the most part underground (this
feature supplying the title of &ldquo;the Underground&rdquo; familiarly applied
to both systems); the tunnels being constructed of brick. The
earliest part of the system was opened in 1863. Although these
railways, as far as concerns the districts they serve, form the fastest
method of communication from point to point, their discomfort,
arising mainly from the impossibility of proper ventilation, and
various other disadvantages attendant upon the use of steam traction,
led to a determination to adapt the lines to electrical working.
Experiments on a short section of the line were made in 1900, and
later schemes were set on foot to electrify the District system and
bring under one general control this railway, other lines in deep
level &ldquo;tubes&rdquo; between Baker Street and Waterloo, between Charing
Cross, Euston and Hampstead, and between Hammersmith,
Brompton, Piccadilly, King&rsquo;s Cross and Finsbury Park, and the
London United Tramways Company. The Underground Electric
Railways Company, which acquired a controlling influence over
these concerns, undertook the construction of a great power station
at Chelsea; while the Metropolitan Company, which had fallen into
line with the District (not without dispute over the system of electrification
to be adopted) erected a station at Neasden on the Aylesbury
branch. Electric traction was gradually introduced on the Metropolitan
and the District lines in 1906. The former company combined
with the Great Western Company as regards the electrification
of, and provision of stock for, the lines which they had previously
worked jointly, from Edgware Road by Bishop&rsquo;s Road to Hammersmith,
&amp;c. The Baker Street &amp; Waterloo railway (known as the
&ldquo;Bakerloo&rdquo;) was opened in 1906 and subsequently extended in one
direction to Paddington and in the other to the Elephant and Castle.
The Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton line, from Finsbury
Park to Hammersmith, was opened early in 1907, and the Charing
Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead line later in the same year. Deep-level
electric railways (&ldquo;tubes&rdquo;), communicating with the surface
by lifts, were already familiar in London. The first opened was the
City &amp; South London (1890), subsequently extended to run between
Euston, the Angel, Islington, the Bank (City) and Clapham. Others
are the Waterloo &amp; City (1898) running from the terminus of the
South-Western railway without intermediate stations to the Bank;
the Central London (1900), from the Bank to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush,
Hammersmith; and the Great Northern &amp; City (1904) from
Finsbury Park (which is an important suburban junction on the
Great Northern railway) to Moorgate Street.</p>

<p><i>Tramways.</i>&mdash;The surface tramway system of London cannot be
complete, as, within an area roughly represented by the boroughs of
Chelsea, Kensington and Fulham, the city of Westminster and a
considerable district north thereof, and the city of London, the
existing streets could not accommodate tram lines along with other
traffic over any great distance consecutively, and in point of fact
there are few, beyond the embankment line from Blackfriars Bridge
to Westminster Bridge, which connects with the southern system.
Another line, running south from Islington, uses the shallow-level
subway under Kingsway and connects with the embankment line.
The northern, western and eastern outskirts and London south
of the Thames are extensively served by trams. On the formation
of the London County Council there were thirteen tramway companies
in existence. Powers under the Tramways Act of 1870
were given to the council, enabling it to acquire possession of these
undertakings, and within the county of London they have been for
the most part so acquired, and are worked by the council. Outside
the county both companies and local authorities own and work
tramways. Both electric and horse traction are used; the latter,
however, has been in great part displaced by the former. The total
mileage for greater London is about 240.</p>

<p><i>Omnibuses.</i>&mdash;The omnibus system is very extensive, embracing
all the principal streets throughout the county and extending over
a large part of Greater London. The two principal omnibus companies
are the London General Omnibus and the London Road Car.
The first omnibus ran between the Bank and Paddington in 1829.
In 1905 and following years motor omnibuses (worked mostly by
internal combustion engines) began to a large extent to supplant
horse traction. The principal existing companies adopted them, and
new companies were formed to work them exclusively. With their
advantages of greater speed and carrying capacity over the horsed
vehicles, their introduction was a most important development,
though their working at first imposed a severe financial strain on
many companies.</p>

<p><i>Cabs.</i>&mdash;The horse-drawn cabs which ply for hire in the streets, or
wait at authorized &ldquo;cab-stands,&rdquo; are of two kinds, the &ldquo;hansom,&rdquo;
a two-wheeled vehicle so named after its inventor (1834) and the
&ldquo;four-wheeler.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hackney coaches&rdquo; for hire are first mentioned
in 1625, when they were kept at inns, and numbered 20. Until 1832
their numbers were restricted, in 1662 to 400, in 1694 to 700, in 1771
to 1000. In some cases a driver owns his cab, but the majority of
vehicles are let to drivers by owners, and the adjustment of terms
between them has led to disputes from time to time. In 1894 a
dispute necessitated the formulation of the &ldquo;Asquith award&rdquo; by
the Rt. Hon. H. H. Asquith as home secretary, and subsequent
modifications of this were only arrived at, as in 1904, after a strike
of the drivers affected. A long-standing cause of complaint on the
part of the public has been the common refusal of cab-drivers to
accept their legal fares, but, on the other hand, several attempts to
introduce cabs with an automatic taximeter failed, until the introduction
of motor cabs, of which a few had already been plying for
some time when in 1907 a large number, provided with taximeters,
were put into service. Subsequently, as the number of &ldquo;taxicabs&rdquo;
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Motor Vehicles</a></span>) increased, that of horse-cabs decreased.</p>

<p><i>Traffic Problem.</i>&mdash;One of the most serious administrative problems
met with in London is that of locomotion, especially as regards the
regulation of traffic in the principal thoroughfares and at the busiest
crossings. The police have powers of control over vehicles and exercise
them admirably; their work in this respect is a constant source
of wonder to foreign visitors. But this control does not meet the
problem of actually lessening the number of vehicles in the main
arteries of traffic. At such crossings as that of the Strand and
Wellington Street, Ludgate Circus and south of the Thames, the
Elephant and Castle, as also in the narrow streets of the City, congestion
is often exceedingly severe, and is aggravated when any main
street is under repair, and diversion of traffic through narrow side
streets becomes necessary. Many street improvements were carried
out, it is true, in the last half of the 19th century, the dates of the
principal being as follows: 1854, Cannon Street; 1864, Southwark
Street; 1870, Holborn Viaduct; 1871, Hamilton Place, Queen
Victoria Street; 1876, Northumberland Avenue; 1882, Tooley
Street; 1883, Hyde Park Corner; 1884, Eastcheap; 1886, Shaftesbury
Avenue; 1887, Charing Cross Road; 1890-1892, Rosebery
Avenue. At the beginning of the 20th century several important
local widenings of streets were put in hand, as for example between
Sloane Street and Hyde Park Corner, in the Strand and at the Marble
Arch (1908). At the same period a great work was undertaken to
meet the want of a proper central communication between north and
south, namely, the construction of a broad thoroughfare, called
Kingsway in honour of King Edward VII., from High Holborn
opposite Southampton Row southward to the Strand, connexion
with which is established at two points through a crescent named
Aldwych. The idea of such a thoroughfare is traceable back to the
time of William IV. The magnitude of the traffic problem as a whole
may be best appreciated by examples of the vast schemes of improvement
which from time to time have been put forward by
responsible individuals. Thus Sir John Wolfe Barry, as chairman
of the Council of the Society of Arts in 1899, proposed to alleviate
congestion of traffic by bridges over and tunnels under the streets at
six points, namely&mdash;Hyde Park Corner, Piccadilly Circus, Ludgate
Circus, Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, Strand and
Wellington Street, and Southwark Bridge and Upper Thames Street.
Another scheme seriously suggested in 1904, to meet existing disabilities
of communication between north and south by linking the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page945" id="page945"></a>945</span>
northern and southern tramway services, involved the removal of the
Charing Cross terminus of the South Eastern and Chatham railway
to the south side of the river, and the construction of a new bridge
in place of the railway bridge. The mere control of existing traffic,
local street improvements and provision of new means of communication
between casual points, were felt to miss the root of the
problem, and in 1903 a Royal Commission was appointed to consider
the whole question of locomotion and transport in London, expert
evidence being taken from engineers, representatives of the various
railway and other companies, of the County Council, borough
councils and police, and others. The commission reported in 1905.<a name="fa3f" id="fa3f" href="#ft3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
<span class="sidenote">Traffic commission 1903.</span>
With regard to street improvements the most important
recommendation was that of the construction of two
main avenues 140 ft. wide, one running west and east,
from Bayswater Road to Whitechapel, and passing through
the city in the neighbourhood of London Wall, and another from
Holloway to the Elephant and Castle, to cross the Thames by a new
bridge above Blackfriars. Four lines of surface tramways and four
railway lines in shallow tunnels were proposed along these avenues.
Many widenings and other improvements of existing thoroughfares,
and extensions of tramways were proposed, and detailed recommendations
were made as regards urban and suburban railways, and the
rehousing of the working population on the outskirts of London.
Finally, the commission made the important recommendation that a
traffic board should be established for London, to exercise a general
supervision of traffic, and to act as a tribunal to which all schemes
of railway and tramway construction should be referred.</p>

<p><i>Thames Steamers.</i>&mdash;A local passenger steamboat service on the
Thames suffers from the disadvantage that the river does not provide
the shortest route between points at any great distance apart, and
that the main thoroughfares between east and west do not touch its
banks, so that passengers along those thoroughfares are not tempted
to use it as a channel of communication. High pier dues, moreover,
contributed to the decline of the traffic, and attempts to overcome
the disinclination of passengers to use the river (at any rate in winter)
show a record of failure. The London, Westminster and Vauxhall
Steamboat Company established in 1840 a service of seven steamboats
between London Bridge and Vauxhall. This company was
bought up by the Citizen and Iron Steamboat Companies in 1865.
The City Steamboat Company, established in 1848, began with eight
boats, and by 1865 had increased their fleet to seventeen, running
from London Bridge to Chelsea. This company was taken over by
the London Steamboat Company in 1875. The sinking of the
&ldquo;Princess Alice&rdquo; in 1878 was a serious blow to the London Steamboat
Company, which collapsed, and was succeeded by the River
Thames Steamboat Navigation Company, which went into liquidation
in 1887. The fleet was bought by a syndicate and sold to the
Victoria Steamboat Association. The Thames Steamboat Company
then took up the service, but early in 1902 announced that it would be
discontinued, although in 1904 it was temporarily resumed. Meanwhile,
however, in 1902 the London County Council had promoted a
bill in Parliament to enable them to run a service of boats on the
Thames. The bill was thrown out on this occasion, but was revived
and passed in 1904, and on the 17th of June 1905 the service was
put into operation. The boats, however, were worked at a loss, and
the service was discontinued in 1909.</p>

<p><i>Foreign Communications.</i>&mdash;A large pleasure traffic is maintained
by the steamers of the New Palace Company and others in summer
between London Bridge and Southend, Clacton and Harwich,
Ramsgate, Margate and other resorts of the Kent coast, and Calais
and Boulogne. Passenger steamers sail from the port of London to
the principal ports of the British Isles and northern Europe, and to all
parts of the world, but the most favoured passenger services to and
from Europe and North America pass through other ports, to which
the railways provide special services of trains from London. The
principal travelling agency in London is that of Messrs Cook, whose
head office is at Ludgate Circus. A number of sub-offices of large
steamship lines are congregated in Cockspur Street, Trafalgar
Square, and several of the principal railway companies have local
offices throughout the centre of the metropolis for the issue of
tickets and the collection and forwarding of luggage and parcels.</p>

<p><i>Post Office.</i>&mdash;The General Post Office lies in the centre of the City
on either side of the street called St Martin&rsquo;s le Grand. The oldest
portion of the buildings, Ionic in style, was designed by Sir Robert
Smirke and erected in 1829. Here are the central offices of the letter,
newspaper and telegraph departments, with the office of the Postmaster
General; but the headquarters of the parcels department are
at Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell; those of the Post Office Savings
Bank at Blythe Road, West Kensington, and those of the Money
Order department in Queen Victoria Street. The postal area
is divided into eight districts, commonly designated by initials
(which it is customary to employ in writing addresses)&mdash;East Central
(E.C., the City, north to Pentonville and City Roads, west to Gray&rsquo;s
Inn Road and the Law Courts); West Central (W.C., from Euston
Road to the Thames, and west to Tottenham Court Road); West
(W., from Piccadilly and Hyde Park north to Marylebone and Edgware
Roads; the greater part of Paddington and Kensington, north
part of Fulham and Hammersmith); South-west (S.W., City of
Westminster south of Piccadilly, Chelsea, South Kensington, the
greater part of Fulham, and London south of the Thames and west
of Vauxhall Bridge); South-east (S.E., remainder of London south
of the Thames); East (E., east of the City and Kingsland Road);
North (N., west of Kingsland Road; Islington); North-west (N.W.,
greater part of St Pancras and St Marylebone, and Hampstead).
The postal area excludes part of Woolwich within the county;
but includes considerable areas outside the county in other directions,
as West Ham, Leyton, &amp;c., on the east; Woodford, Chingford, &amp;c.,
on the north-east; Wood Green, Southgate and Finchley on the
north; Hendon and Willesden on the north-west; Acton and Ealing,
Barnes and Wimbledon on the west; and Penge and Beckenham on
the south, wholly or in part. There are ten district head offices
and about a thousand local offices in the metropolitan district.</p>

<p><i>Telephones.</i>&mdash;The National Telephone Company, working under
licence expiring on the 31st of December 1911, had until 1901 practically
a monopoly of telephonic communication within London, though
the Post Office owned all the trunk lines connecting the various
telephone areas of the company. The company&rsquo;s management did
not give satisfaction, and the use of the telephone was consequently
restricted in the metropolis, when in 1898 a Select Committee on
Telephones reported that &ldquo;general immediate and effective&rdquo; competition
by either the government or local authority was necessary
to ensure efficient working. The Post Office thereupon instituted a
separate system of exchanges and lines, intercommunication between
the two systems being arranged. Charges were reduced and efficiency
benefited by this movement. The area covered by the local as
distinct from the trunk service is about 630 sq. m. extending to
Romford, Enfield, Harrow, &amp;c., north of the Thames, and to Dartford
Reigate, Epsom, &amp;c., south of it. Public call offices are provided
in numerous shops, railway stations and other public places, and
at many post offices. The District Messengers Company affords
facilities through local offices for the use of special messengers.</p>

<p>The reason for the decrease in the resident City population is
to be found in the rapid extension of business premises, while
the widening ramifications of the outer residential areas are
illustrated by the increase in the later years of the population
of the Outer Ring. The growth and population of London
previous to the 19th century is considered under <i>History</i>, <i>ad. fin.</i></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The foreign-born population of London was 60,252 in 1881, and
135,377 in 1901. During 1901, 27,070 aliens (excluding sailors)
arrived at the port, and in 1902, 33,060. Of these last
Russians and Poles numbered 21,013; Germans, 3386;
<span class="sidenote">Aliens.</span>
Austrians and Hungarians, 2197; Dutch, 1902; Norwegians,
Swedes and Danes, 1341; and Rumanians, 1016. Other nationalities
numbered below one thousand each. The foreign-born population
shows a large increase in percentage to the whole, being 1.57
in 1881 and 2.98 in 1901. Residents of Irish birth have decreased
since 1851; those of Scottish birth have increased steadily, and
roughly as the population. German residents are found mainly in
the western and west central districts; French mainly in the City
of Westminster (especially the district of Soho), St Pancras and St
Marylebone; Italians in Holborn (Saffron Hill), Soho and Finsbury;
and Russians and Poles in Stepney and Bethnal Green.</p>

<p class="noind">In 1905 the lowest death-rates among the metropolitan boroughs
were returned by Hampstead (9.3), Lewisham (11.7), Wandsworth
(12.6), Woolwich (12.8), Stoke Newington (12.9), and the highest by
Shoreditch (19.7), Finsbury (19.0), Bermondsey (18.7), Bethnal
Green (18.6) and Southwark (18.5). A return of the percentage of
inhabitants dwelling in over-crowded tenements shows 2.7 for Lewisham,
4.5 for Wandsworth, 5.5 for Stoke Newington, and 6.4 for
Hampstead, against 35.2 for Finsbury and 29.9 for Shoreditch.</p>

<p><i>Sanitation.</i>&mdash;As regards sanitation London is under special
regulations. When the statutes relating to public health were consolidated
and amended in 1875 London was excluded; and the law
applicable to it was specially consolidated and amended in 1891.
The London County Council is a central sanitary authority; the
City and metropolitan boroughs are sanitary districts, and the Corporation
and borough councils are local sanitary authorities. The
County Council deals directly with matters where uniformity of
administration is essential, <i>e.g.</i> main drainage, housing of working
classes, infant life protection, common lodging-houses and shelters,
and contagious diseases of animals. With a further view to uniformity
it has certain powers of supervision and control over local
authorities, and can make by-laws respecting construction of local
sewers, sanitary conveniences, offensive trades, slaughter-houses
and dairies, and prevention of nuisances outside the jurisdiction of
local authorities. A medical officer of health for the whole county
is appointed by the Council, which also pays half the salaries of local
medical officers and sanitary inspectors. The Council may also act in
cases of default by the local authorities, or may make representations
to the Local Government Board respecting such default, whereupon
the Board may direct the Council to withhold payment due to the
local authority under the Equalization of Rates Act 1894.</p>

<p>The first act providing for a commission of sewers in London dates
from 1531. Various works of a more or less imperfect character
were carried out, such as the bridging over in 1637 of the
river Fleet, which as early as 1307 had become inaccessible
<span class="sidenote">Drainage.</span>
to shipping through the accumulation of filth. Scavengers were
employed in early times, and sewage was received into wells and
pumped into the kennels of the streets. A system of main drainage
was inaugurated by the Commissioners of Sewers in 1849, but their
work proceeded very slowly. It was carried on more effectively by
the Metropolitan Board of Works (1856-1888) which expended over
six-and-a-half millions sterling on the work. The London County
Council maintained, completed and improved the system. The
length of sewers in the main system is about 288 m., and their
construction has cost about eight millions. The system covers the
county of London, West Ham, Penge, Tottenham, Wood Green, and
parts of Beckenham, Hornsey, Croydon, Willesden, East Ham and
Acton. There are actually two distinct systems, north and south of
the Thames, having separate outfall works on the north and south
banks of the river, at Barking and Crossness. The clear effluent
flows into the Thames, and the sludge is taken 50 m. out to sea.
The annual cost of maintenance of the system exceeds £250,000.
The sanitary authorities are concerned only with the supervision of
house drainage, and the construction and maintenance of local
sewers discharging into the main system. The Thames and the Lea
Conservancies have powers to guard against the pollution of the
rivers.</p>

<p><i>Hospitals.</i>&mdash;The Metropolitan Asylums Board, though established
in 1867 purely as a poor-law authority for the relief of the sick, insane
and infirm paupers, has become a central hospital
authority for infectious diseases, with power to receive into
<span class="sidenote">Metropolitan Asylums Board.</span>
its hospitals persons, who are not paupers, suffering from
fever, smallpox or diphtheria. Both the Board and the
County Council have certain powers and duties of sanitary
authority for the purpose of epidemic regulations. The local sanitary
authorities carry out the provisions of the Infectious Diseases
(Notification and Prevention) Acts, which for London are embodied
in the Public Health (London) Act 1891. The Board has asylums
for the insane at Tooting Bec (Wandsworth), Ealing (for children);
King&rsquo;s Langley, Hertfordshire; Caterham, Surrey; and Darenth,
Kent. There are twelve fever hospitals, including northern and
southern convalescent hospitals. For smallpox the Board maintains
hospital ships moored in the Thames at Dartford, and a land
establishment at the same place. There are land and river
ambulance services.</p>

<p>There are three regular funds in London for the support of
hospitals. (1) King Edward&rsquo;s Hospital Fund (1897) founded by
King Edward VII. as Prince of Wales in commemoration of the
Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The League of Mercy, under
royal charter, operates in conjunction with the Fund in the collection
of small subscriptions. The Order of Mercy was instituted by the
King as a reward for distinguished personal service. (2) The
Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund, founded in 1873, draws the
greater part of its revenue from collections in churches on stated
occasions. (3) The Metropolitan Hospital Saturday Fund was
founded in 1873, and is made up chiefly of small sums collected in
places of business, &amp;c. The following is a list of the principal London
hospitals, with dates of foundation:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Water Supply.</i>&mdash;In the 12th century London was supplied with
water from local streams and wells, of which Holy Well, Clerk&rsquo;s Well
(Clerkenwell) and St Clement&rsquo;s Well, near St Clement&rsquo;s Inn, were
examples. In 1236 the magistrates purchased the liberty to convey
the waters of the Tyburn from Paddington to the City by leaden
pipes, and a great conduit was erected in West Cheap in 1285.
Other conduits were subsequently built (cf. Conduit Street off Bond
Street, Lamb&rsquo;s Conduit Street, Bloomsbury); and water was also
supplied by the company of water-bearers in leathern panniers borne
by horses. In 1582 Peter Moris, a Dutchman, erected a &ldquo;forcier&rdquo;
on an arch of London Bridge, which he rented for 10s. per annum for
500 years. His works succeeded and increased, and continued in his
family till 1701, when a company took over the lease. Other
forciers had been set up, and in 1609, on an act of 1605, Sir Hugh
Myddelton undertook the task of supplying reservoirs at Clerkenwell
through the New river from springs near Ware, Hertfordshire; and
these were opened in 1613. In 1630 a scheme to bring water from
Hoddesdon on the Lea was promoted by aid of a lottery licensed by
Charles I. The Chelsea Water Company opened its supply from the
Thames in 1721; the Lambeth waterworks were erected in 1783;
the Vauxhall Company was established in 1805, the West Middlesex,
near Hammersmith, and the East London on the river Lea in 1806,
the Kent on the Ravensbourne (Deptford) in 1810, the Grand
Junction in 1811, and the Southwark (which amalgamated with the
Vauxhall) in 1822.</p>

<p>For many years proposals to amalgamate the working of the
companies and displace them by a central public authority were
put forward from time to time. The difficulty of administration lay
in the fact that of the area of 620 sq. m. constituting what is known
as &ldquo;Water London&rdquo; (see map in <i>London Statistics</i>, vol. xix., issued
by the L.C.C., 1909) the London County Council has authority over
little more than one-third, and therefore when the Council proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page947" id="page947"></a>947</span>
to acquire the eight undertakings concerned its scheme was opposed
not only by the companies but by the county councils and local
authorities outside the County of London. The Council had a
scheme of bringing water to London from Wales, in view of increasing
demands on a stationary supply. This involved impounding the
headwaters of the Wye, the Towey and the Usk, and the total cost
was estimated to exceed fifteen millions sterling. The capacity of
existing sources, however, was deemed sufficient by a Royal Commission
under Lord Balfour of Burleigh in 1893, and this opinion was
endorsed by a further Commission under Lord Llandaff. The
construction of large storage reservoirs was recommended, and this
work was put in hand jointly by the New River, West Middlesex and
Grand Junction companies at Staines on the Thames. As regards
administration, Lord Llandaff&rsquo;s Commission recommended the creation
<span class="sidenote">Metropolitan Water Board.</span>
of a Water Trust, and in 1902 the Metropolis Water Act
constituted the Metropolitan Water Board to purchase
and carry on the undertakings of the eight companies,
and of certain local authorities. It consists of 66 members,
appointed by the London County Council (14), the City of
London and the City of Westminster (2 each), the other Metropolitan
boroughs (1 each), the county councils of Middlesex, Hertfordshire,
Essex, Kent and Surrey (l each), borough of West Ham (2), various
groups of other boroughs and urban districts, and the Thames and
the Lea Conservancies. The first election of the Board took place in
1903. The 24th of June, 1904, was the date fixed on which control
passed to the Board, and in the meantime a Court of Arbitration
adjudicated the claims of the companies for compensation for the
acquisition of their properties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water London&rdquo; is an irregular area extending from Ware in
Hertfordshire to Sevenoaks in Kent, and westward as far as Ealing
and Sunbury.</p>

<p>A constant supply is maintained generally throughout &ldquo;Water
London,&rdquo; although a suspension between certain hours has been
occasionally necessitated, as in 1895 and 1898, when, during summer
droughts, the East London supply was so affected. During these
periods other companies had a surplus of water, and in 1899 an
act was passed providing for the interconnexion of systems. The
Thames and Lea are the principal sources of supply, but the Kent
and (partially) the New River Company draw supplies from springs.
The systems of filtration employed by the different companies varied
in efficacy, but both the Royal Commissions decided that water
as supplied to the consumer was generally of a very high standard
of purity. The expenditure of the Water Board for 1907-1908
amounted to £2,846,265. Debt charges absorbed £1,512,718 of this
amount.</p>

<p>Public baths and washhouses are provided by local authorities
under various acts between 1846 and 1896, which have been adopted
by all the borough councils.</p>

<p><i>Lighting.</i>&mdash;From 1416 citizens were obliged to hang out candles
between certain hours on dark nights to illuminate the streets. An
act of parliament enforced this in 1661; in 1684 Edward Heming,
the inventor of oil lamps, obtained licence to supply public lights;
and in 1736 the corporation took the matter in hand, levying a rate.
Gas-lighting was introduced on one side of Pall Mall in 1807, and
in 1810 the Gas Light &amp; Coke Company received a charter, and
developed gas-lighting in Westminster. The City of London Gas
Company followed in 1817, and seven other companies soon after.
Wasteful competition ensued until in 1857 an agreement was made
between the companies to restrict their services to separate localities,
and the Gas Light &amp; Coke Company, by amalgamating other companies,
then gradually acquired all the gas-lighting north of the
Thames, while a considerable area in the south was provided for by
another great gas company, the South Metropolitan. Various acts
from 1860 onwards have laid down laws as to the quality and cost of
gas. Gas must be supplied at 16-candle illuminating power, and is
officially tested by the chemists&rsquo; department of the London County
Council. The amalgamations mentioned were effected subsequently
to 1860, and there are now three principal companies within the
county, the Gas Light &amp; Coke, South Metropolitan and Commercial,
though certain other companies supply some of the outlying districts.
As regards street lighting, the extended use of burners with incandescent
mantles has been of good effect. The Metropolitan
Board of Works, and the commissioners of sewers in the City, began
experiments with electric light. At the close of the 19th and the
beginning of the 20th century a large number of electric light
companies came into existence, and some of the metropolitan
borough councils, and local authorities within Greater London, also
undertook the supply. An extensive use of the light resulted in the
principal streets and in shops, offices and private houses.</p>

<p><i>Fire.</i>&mdash;In 1832 the fire insurance companies united to maintain a
small fire brigade, and continued to do so until 1866. The brigade
was confined to the central part of the metropolis; for the rest, the
parochial authorities had charge of protection from fire. The central
brigade came under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works;
and the County Council now manages the Metropolitan Fire Brigade,
under a chief officer and a staff numbering about 1300. The cost of
maintenance exceeds £200,000 annually; contributions towards this
are made by the Treasury and the fire insurance companies. The
Council controls the provision of fire escapes in factories employing
over 40 persons, under an act of 1901; it also compels the maintenance
of proper precautions against fire in theatres and places of
entertainments. A Salvage Corps is independently maintained by
the Insurance Companies.</p>

<p><i>Cemeteries.</i>&mdash;The administrative authorities of cemeteries for the
county are the borough councils and the City Corporation and
private companies. The large cemetery at Brompton is the property
of the government. Kensal Green cemetery, the burial-place of
many famous persons, is of great extent, but several large cemeteries
outside the metropolis have come into use. Such are that of the
London Necropolis Company at Brookwood near Woking, Surrey,
and that of the parishes of St Mary Abbots, Kensington, and St
George, Hanover Square, at Hanwell, Middlesex. Crematoria are
provided at certain of the companies&rsquo; cemeteries, and the Cremation
Act 1902 enabled borough councils to provide crematoria.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">V. <span class="sc">Education and Recreation</span></p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;The British and Foreign School Society (1808) and
the National Society (1811), together with the Ragged Schools Union
(1844), were the only special organizations providing for
the education of the poorer classes until 1870. To meet
<span class="sidenote">Elementary education.</span>
the demand for elementary education, increasing as it did
with population, was beyond the powers of these societies,
the churches and the various charitable institutions. Thus a return
of 1871 showed that the schools were capable of accommodating only
39% of the children of school-going age. In 1870, however, a
School Board had been created in addition, and this body carried out
much good work during its thirty-four years of existence. In 1903
the Education (London) Act was passed in pursuance of the general
system, put into operation by the Education Act (1902) of bringing
education within the scope of municipal government. The County
Council was created a local education authority, and given control of
secular education in both board and voluntary schools. It appoints
an education committee in accordance with a scheme approved by
the Board of Education. This scheme must allow of the Council
selecting at least a majority of the committee, and must provide for
the inclusion of experts and women. Each school or group of schools
is under a body of managers, in the appointment of whom the borough
council and the County Council share in the following proportions:&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
<i>Board or provided schools</i>; borough council, two-thirds; county
council, one-third: (<i>b</i>) <i>Voluntary or non-provided schools</i>; the
foundation, two-thirds; borough council and county council, each
one-sixth. The total number of public elementary schools was 963
in 1905, with 752,487 scholars on the register. Other institutions
include higher elementary schools for pupils certified to be able to
profit by higher instruction; and schools for blind, deaf and defective
children. Instruction for teachers is provided in pupil teachers&rsquo;
centres (preparatory), and in residential and day training colleges.
There are about 15 such colleges. Previous to the act of 1903 the
<span class="sidenote">Technical education.</span>
County Council had educational powers under the
Technical Instructions Acts which enabled it to provide
technical education through a special board, merged by
the act of 1903 in the education committee. The City and
Guilds of London Institute, Gresham College, also maintains
various technical institutions. The establishment of polytechnics
was provided for by the City of London Parochial Charities Act
1883; the charities being administered by trustees. The model institution
was that of Mr Quintin Hogg (1880) in Regent Street, where
a striking statue by George Frampton (1906) commemorates him.
The general scope of the polytechnics is to give instruction both in
general knowledge and special crafts or trades by means of classes,
lectures and laboratories, instructive entertainments and exhibitions,
and facilities for bodily and mental exercise (gymnasia, libraries, &amp;c.).
Other similar institutions exist primarily for special purposes, as the
St Bride Foundation Institute, near Fleet Street, in immediate
proximity to the great newspaper offices, for the printing trade, and
the Herolds&rsquo; Institute, a branch of the Borough Polytechnic situated
in Bermondsey, for the purposes of the leather trade. The County
Council also aids numerous separate schools of art, both general and
special, such as the Royal School of Art Needlework and the School
of Art Woodcarving; the City and Guilds Institute maintains similar
establishments at some of its colleges, and art schools are also
generally attached to the polytechnics.</p>

<p>The London County Council maintains a number of industrial
schools and reformatories, both in London and in the country, for
children who have shown or are likely to be misled into a
<span class="sidenote">Philanthropical institutions.</span>
tendency towards lawlessness. The City Corporation has
separate responsibilities in the same direction, but has
no schools of its own. The expenditure of the London
County Council on education for 1907-1908 was £4,281,291
for elementary education, and £742,962 for higher education.</p>

<p>The work of private philanthropists and philanthropical bodies
among the poor of East London, Southwark and Bermondsey, and
elsewhere, fails to be noticed at this point. The labours of the
regular clergy here lie largely in the direction of social reform, and
churches and missions have been established and are maintained by
colleges, such as Christ Church, Oxford, schools and other bodies.
There are, further, &ldquo;settlements&rdquo; where members of the various
bodies may reside in order to devote themselves to philanthropical
work; and these include clubs, recreation rooms and other institutions
for the use of the poor. Such are the Oxford House, Bethnal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page948" id="page948"></a>948</span>
Green; the Cambridge House, Camberwell Road; Toynbee Hall,
Whitechapel; Mansfield House, Canning Town; the Robert
Browning Settlement, Southwark; and the Passmore Edwards
Settlement, St Pancras. There are also several women&rsquo;s settlements
of a similar character. The People&rsquo;s Palace, Mile End Road, opened
in 1887, is both a recreative and an educational institution (called
East London College) erected and subsequently extended mainly
through the liberality of the Drapers&rsquo; Company and of private
donors.</p>

<p>In early times the priories and other religious houses had generally
grammar schools attached to them. Those at St Peter&rsquo;s, Westminster,
and St Paul&rsquo;s, attained a fame which has survived, while
other similar foundations lapsed, such as St Anthony&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Public schools.</span>
(Threadneedle Street, City), at which Sir Thomas More,
Archbishop Whitgift and many other men of eminence received
education. Certain of the schools were re-endowed after the dissolution
of the monasteries. St Peter&rsquo;s College or Westminster
School (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Westminster</a></span>) is unique among English public schools of
the highest rank in maintaining its original situation in London.
Other early metropolitan foundations have been moved in accordance
with modern tendencies either into the country or to sites aloof
from the heart of London. Thus Charterhouse school, part of the
foundation of Sir Thomas Sutton (1611), was moved from Finsbury
to Godalming, Surrey; St Paul&rsquo;s School occupies modern buildings
at Hammersmith, and Christ&rsquo;s Hospital is at Horsham, Sussex. Of
other schools, Merchant Taylors&rsquo; was founded by the Company of
that name in 1561, and has occupied, since 1875, the premises vacated
by Charterhouse School. The Mercers&rsquo; School, Dowgate, was originally
attached to the hospital of St Thomas of Acon, which was sold
to the Mercers&rsquo; Company in 1522, on condition that the company
should maintain the school. The City of London School, founded in
Milk Street, Cheapside, by the City Corporation in 1835, occupies
modern buildings on the Victoria Embankment. Dulwich College
originated in the foundation of the College of God&rsquo;s Gift by Edward
Alleyn in 1626, and is now constituted as one of the principal English
public schools. St Olave&rsquo;s and St Saviour&rsquo;s grammar school, Southwark,
received its charter in 1571. Both classical and modern
education is provided; a large number of scholarships are maintained
out of the foundation, and exhibitions from the school to the universities
and other higher educational institutions.</p>

<p><i>London University.</i>&mdash;The University of London was incorporated
by royal charter in 1836, as an examining body for conferring degrees.
Its scope and powers were extended by subsequent charters, and in
1900, under the University of London Act 1898, it was reorganized
as both a teaching and an examining body. The function of the
academic department is to control the teaching branch, internal
examinations, &amp;c., and that of the external department to control
external examinations, while the university extension system
occupies a third department. The university is governed by a
senate consisting of a chancellor, chairman of convocation and 54
members, whose appointment is shared by the Crown, convocation,
the Royal Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons, the Inns of Court,
the Law Society, the London County Council, City Corporation,
City and Guilds Institute, University and King&rsquo;s Colleges and the
faculties. The faculties are theology, arts, law, music, medicine,
science, engineering and economics. The schools of the University
include University College, Gower Street, and King&rsquo;s College,
Somerset House (with both of which preparatory schools are connected),
East London College and numerous institutions devoted to
special faculties both within and without London. The university
in part occupies buildings which formerly belonged to the Imperial
Institute.</p>

<p><i>Other Educational Institutions.</i>&mdash;The Board of Education directly
administers the following educational institutions&mdash;the Victoria and
Albert Museum, South Kensington, with its branch at Bethnal
Green, from both of which objects are lent to various institutions
for educational purposes; the Royal College of Science, South
Kensington, with which is incorporated the Royal School of Mines;
the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom and the Museum of
Practical Geology, Jermyn Street; the Solar Physics Observatory,
South Kensington; and the Royal College of Art, South Kensington.
At Gresham College, Basinghall Street, City, founded in 1597 by
Sir Thomas Gresham, and moved to its present site in 1843, lectures
are given in the principal branches of science, law, divinity,
medicine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some further important establishments and institutions may be
tabulated here:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Architecture.</i>&mdash;The Royal Institute of British Architects, Conduit
Street, conducts examinations and awards diplomas.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;The College of Preceptors, Bloomsbury, conducts
examinations of persons engaged in education and awards diplomas.</p>

<p><i>Engineering.</i>&mdash;A School of Practical Engineering is maintained at
the Crystal Palace, Sydenham.</p>

<p><i>Law.</i>&mdash;The Inns of Court are four&mdash;Middle Temple, Inner Temple,
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, Gray&rsquo;s Inn. A joint board of examiners examines
students previous to admission. The Council of Legal Education
superintends the education and subsequent examination of students.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Inns of Court</a></span>.) The Law Society is the superintending body
for examination and admission in the case of solicitors.</p>

<p><i>Medical.</i>&mdash;The Royal College of Physicians is in Pall Mall East,
and the Royal College of Surgeons is in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. The
Society of Apothecaries is in Water Lane, City. The Royal College
of Veterinary Surgeons is in Red Lion Square, and the Royal
Veterinary College at Camden Town. (The principal hospitals
having schools are noted in the list of hospitals, Section VII.)</p>

<p><i>Military and Naval.</i>&mdash;The Royal Military College and the Ordnance
College are at Woolwich; the Royal Naval College at Greenwich.</p>

<p><i>Music.</i>&mdash;The principal educational institutions are&mdash;the Royal
Academy of Music, Tenterden Street, Hanover Square; the Royal
College of Music, South Kensington; Guildhall School, City, near
the Victoria Embankment; London College, Great Marlborough
Street; Trinity College, Manchester Square; Victoria College,
Berners Street; and the Royal College of Organists, Bloomsbury.</p>

<p><i>Scientific Societies.</i>&mdash;Numerous learned societies have their headquarters
in London, and the following may especially be noticed here.
Burlington House, in Piccadilly, built in 1872 on the site of a mansion
of the earls of Burlington, houses the Royal Society, the Chemical,
Geological, Linnaean and Royal Astronomical Societies, the Society
of Antiquaries and the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, of which the annual meetings take place at different
British or colonial towns in succession. The Royal Society, the most
dignified and influential of all, was incorporated by Charles II. in
1663. It originally occupied rooms in Crane Court, City, and was
moved in 1780 to Somerset House, where others of the societies named
were also located. The Society of Arts, John Street, Adelphi, was
established in 1754 for the encouragement of arts, manufactures and
commerce. The Royal Institution, Albemarle Street, was founded
in 1799, maintains a library and laboratories and promotes research
in connexion with the experimental sciences. The Royal Geographical
Society, occupying a building close to Burlington House
in Savile Row, maintains a map-room open to the public, holds
lectures by prominent explorers and geographers, and takes a leading
part in the promotion of geographical discovery. The Royal Botanic
Society has private gardens in the midst of Regent&rsquo;s Park, where
flower shows and general entertainments are held. The Royal
Horticultural Society maintains gardens at Wisley, Surrey, and has
an exhibition hall in Vincent Square, Westminster. The exhibitions
of the Royal Agricultural Society are held at Park Royal, near
Willesden. The Zoological Society maintains a magnificent collection
of living specimens in the Zoological Gardens, Regent&rsquo;s Park, a
popular resort.</p>

<p><i>Museums, Art Galleries, Libraries.</i>&mdash;In the British Museum London
possesses one of the most celebrated collections in the world, originated
in 1753 by the purchase of Sir Hans Sloane&rsquo;s collection and
library by the government. The great building in Bloomsbury
(1828-1852) with its massive Ionic portico, houses the collections of
antiquities, coins, books, manuscripts and drawings, and contains
the reading-rooms for the use of readers. The natural history branch
was removed to a building at South Kensington (the Natural History
Museum) in 1881, where the zoological, botanical and mineralogical
exhibits are kept. Close to this museum is the Victoria and Albert
Museum (formerly South Kensington Museum, 1857) for which an
extension of buildings, from a fine design by Sir Aston Webb, was
begun in 1899 and completed in ten years. Here are collections of
pictures and drawings, including the Raphael cartoons, objects of
art of every description, mechanical and scientific collections, and
Japanese, Chinese and Persian collections, and an Indian section.
In the vicinity, also, is the fine building of the Imperial Institute,
founded in 1887 as an exhibition to illustrate the resources of all
parts of the Empire, as well as an institution for the furtherance of
imperial intercourse; though not developed on the scale originally
intended. Other museums are Sir John Soane&rsquo;s collection in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields and the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn
Street, while the scientific societies have libraries and in some cases
collections of a specialized character, such as the museums of the
Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal Architectural Society, and the
Society of Art and the Parkes Museum of the Sanitary Institute.
Among permanent art collections the first place is taken by the
National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. This magnificent collection
was originated in 1824, and the building dates from 1838, but has been
more than once enlarged. The building of the National Portrait
Gallery, adjoining it, dates from 1896, but the nucleus of the collection
was formed in 1858. The munificence of Sir Henry Tate provided
the gallery, commonly named after him, by the Thames near
Vauxhall Bridge, which contains the national collection of British
art. The Wallace collection of paintings and objects of art, in
Hertford House, Manchester Square, was bequeathed to the nation
by the widow of Sir Richard Wallace in 1897. Dulwich College
possesses a fine series of paintings, of the Dutch and other schools,
bequeathed by Sir P. F. Bourgeois in 1811. There are also notable
collections of pictures in several of the mansions of the nobility,
government buildings, halls of the City Companies and elsewhere.
No gallery in London is exclusively or especially devoted to sculpture.
Of the periodical art exhibitions that of the Royal Academy is most
noteworthy. It is held annually at Burlington House from the first
Monday in May to the first Monday in August. It consists mainly
of paintings, but includes a few drawings and examples of sculpture.
Earlier in each year exhibitions of works by deceased British artists
and by old masters are held, and the Gibson and Diploma Galleries
are permanent exhibitions. At the Guildhall special exhibitions are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page949" id="page949"></a>949</span>
held from time to time. There are a number of art galleries in and
about Bond Street and Piccadilly, Regent Street and Pall Mall, such
as the New Gallery, where periodical exhibitions are given by the
New English Art Club, the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colours,
the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours, other
societies and art dealers.</p>

<p>Municipal provision of public libraries under acts of 1892 and
1893 is general throughout London, and these institutions are exceedingly
popular for purposes both of reference and of loan. The
acts are extended to include the provisions of museums and art
galleries, but the borough councils have not as a rule availed themselves
of this extension. The London County Council administers
the Horniman Museum at Forest Hill, Lewisham. The City Corporation
maintains the fine Guildhall library and museum. A few free
libraries are supported by donations and subscriptions or charities.
Besides the Government reference libraries at the British Museum
and South Kensington there are other such libraries, of a specialized
character, as at the Patent Office and the Record Office. Among
lending libraries should be noticed the London Library in St James&rsquo;s
Square, Pall Mall.</p>

<p><i>Theatres and Places of Entertainment.</i>&mdash;The principal London
theatres lie between Piccadilly and Temple Bar, and High Holborn
and Victoria Street, the majority being in Shaftesbury Avenue, the
Haymarket, the neighbourhood of Charing Cross and the Strand.
At these central theatres successful plays are allowed to &ldquo;run&rdquo;
for protracted periods, but there are numerous fine houses in other
parts of London which are generally occupied by a succession of
touring companies presenting either revivals of popular plays or
plays successful at the moment in the central theatres. The principal
music halls (variety theatres) are in Shaftesbury Avenue, Piccadilly
Circus, Leicester Square and the Strand. The Covent Garden
theatre is the principal home of grand opera; the building, though
spacious, suffers by comparison with the magnificence of opera
houses in some other capitals, but during the opera season the scene
within the theatre is brilliant. The chief halls devoted mainly to
concerts are the Royal Albert Hall, close to the South Kensington
museums, and Queen&rsquo;s Hall in Langham Place, Regent Street. For
a long time St James&rsquo;s Hall (demolished in 1905) between Regent
Street and Piccadilly was the chief concert hall. Oratorio is given
usually in the Albert Hall, the vast area of which is especially suited
for a large chorus and orchestra, and at the Crystal Palace (<i>q.v.</i>).
This latter building, standing on high ground at Sydenham, and
visible from far over the metropolis, is devoted not only to concerts,
but to general entertainment, and the extensive grounds give accommodation
for a variety of sports and amusements. Among other
popular places of entertainment may be mentioned the exhibition
grounds and buildings at Earl&rsquo;s Court; similar grounds at Shepherd&rsquo;s
Bush, where a Franco-British Exhibition was held in 1908, an
Imperial Exhibition in 1909, and an Anglo-Japanese in 1910; the
great Olympia hall, West Kensington; the celebrated wax-work
exhibition of Madame Tussaud in Marylebone Road; the Alexandra
Palace, Muswell Hill, an institution resembling the Crystal Palace;
and the Agricultural Hall, Islington, where agricultural and other
exhibitions are held. The well-known Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly
was taken down in 1906, and the permanent conjuring entertainment
for which (besides picture exhibitions) it was noted was removed
elsewhere. Theatres, music halls, concert halls and other places
of entertainment are licensed by the County Council, except that the
licence for stage-plays is granted by the lord chamberlain under the
Theatres Act 1843. The council provides for inspection of places
of entertainment in respect of precautions against fire, structural
safety, &amp;c. The principal clubs are in and about Piccadilly and Pall
Mall (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Club</a></span>). A club for soldiers, sailors and marines in London,
called the Union Jack Club, was opened in Waterloo Road by King
Edward VII. in 1907.</p>

<p><i>Parks and Open Spaces: Administration.</i>&mdash;The administration of
parks and open spaces in and round London, topographical details
of the principal of which are given in Section I., is divided between
the Office of Works, the London County Council, the City Corporation
and the borough councils. The Office of Works controls the Royal
parks, the County Council controls the larger parks and open spaces
not under Government or City control, and the borough councils the
smaller; while the City Corporation controls certain public grounds
outside the County of London. There are a few other bodies controlling
particular open spaces, as the following list of public grounds
exceeding 50 acres (in 1910) will show:&mdash;</p>

<p>Wimbledon and Putney Commons are under a board of conservators.
The London County Council&rsquo;s parks and open spaces
increased in number from 40 in 1890 to 114 in 1907, and in acreage
from 2656 to 5006 in the same years. The expenditure in 1907-1908
was £131,582, which sum included £11,987 for bands. (See also
separate articles on boroughs.)</p>

<p>Bathing (at certain hours) and boating are permitted in the ornamental
waters in several of the parks, music is provided and much
attention is paid to the protection of waterfowl and other birds,
while herds of deer are maintained in some places, and also botanical
gardens. Surplus plants and cuttings are generally distributed
without charge to educational or charitable institutions, and to the
poor. Provision is made for cricket, football and other games in a
number of the parks. Large gatherings of spectators are attracted
to the first-class cricket matches played at Lord&rsquo;s ground, St John&rsquo;s
Wood, by the Marylebone Club and the Middlesex County teams,
Eton College against Harrow School, and Oxford against Cambridge
University; to the Kennington Oval for the matches of the Surrey
club, and the Leyton ground for those of the Essex club. In the
Crystal Palace grounds the final match for the English Association
Football cup is generally played, and huge crowds from both the
metropolis and the provinces witness the game. At Queen&rsquo;s Club,
West Kensington, the annual Oxford and Cambridge athletic meeting
and others take place, besides football matches, and there is covered
accommodation for tennis and other games. Professional association
football teams are maintained locally in several parts of London,
and much popular interest is taken in their matches. Rugby football
is upheld by such notable teams as Blackheath and Richmond.
Fashionable society takes its pastimes at such centres as the grounds
of the Hurlingham and Ranelagh clubs, at Fulham and Barnes
respectively, where polo and other games are played; and Rotten
Row, the horse-track in Hyde Park, is the favourite resort of riders.
In summer, boating on the lovely reaches of the Thames above the
metropolis forms the recreation of thousands. The growth of popularity
of the cycle, and later of the motor-car, has been a principal
factor in the wide development of a tendency to leave London
during the &ldquo;week-end,&rdquo; that is to say, as a rule, for Saturday afternoon
and Sunday. With many this is a practice at all seasons, and
the railway companies foster the habit by means of tickets at reduced
fares to all parts. The watering-places of the Sussex, Kent and
Essex coasts, and pre-eminently Brighton, are specially favoured
for these brief holidays.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">VI. Commerce</span></p>

<p><i>Port of London.</i>&mdash;The extent of the Port of London has been
variously defined for different purposes, but for those of the
Port Authority it is taken to extend from Teddington Lock to a
line between Yantlet Creek in Kent and the City Stone opposite
Canvey Isle and in Essex. London Bridge is to outward appearance
the up-river limit of the port. There are wharves and a
large carrying trade in barges above this point, but below it the
river is crowded with shipping, and extensive docks open on
either hand.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the 19th century evidence was accumulating
that the development of the Port of London was not keeping
pace with that of shipping generally. In 1900 a Royal Commission
was appointed to investigate the existing administration
of the port, the alleged inadequacy of accommodation for
vessels and kindred questions, and to advance a scheme of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page950" id="page950"></a>950</span>
reform. The report, issued in 1902, showed apprehension to be
well founded. The river, it was ascertained, was not kept
sufficiently dredged; the re-export trade was noted as showing
an especially serious decline, and the administration was found
to suffer from decentralization. The recommendations of the
Commission included the creation of a single controlling authority
to take over the powers of the Thames Conservancy Watermen&rsquo;s
Company, and Trinity House and the docks of the companies
already detailed. This authority, it was advised, should consist
of 40 members, of whom 11 should be nominated by the London
County Council and 3 by the Corporation of the City (supposing
these bodies to accept certain financial responsibilities proposed
in the direction of river improvements), 5 by the governors
of the Bank of England from the mercantile community, 2 by
the London Chamber of Commerce, and 1 each by the Admiralty,
Board of Trade and Trinity House. The remaining members
should be elected by various groups, <i>e.g.</i> shipowners, barge
owners, the railway companies interested, &amp;c. Rival schemes,
however, were proposed by the London County Council, which
proposed to take over the entire control through a committee,
by the City Corporation, which suggested that it should appoint
10 instead of 3 members to the new board; and by the London
Chamber of Commerce, which proposed a Harbour Trust of
<i>ex-officio</i> and elected members. The Thames Conservancy also
offered itself as the public authority. In 1902 a Mansion House
Conference was convened by the lord mayor and a deputation
was appointed which in 1903 pressed the solution of the matter
upon the government.</p>

<p>A noteworthy scheme to improve the condition of the Thames,
first put forward in 1902-1903, was that of constructing a dam
with four locks across the river between Gravesend
and Tilbury. The estimated cost was between three
<span class="sidenote">Thames barrage scheme.</span>
and four millions sterling, to be met by a toll, and it
was urged that a uniform depth, independent of tides,
would be ensured above the dam, that delay of large vessels
wishing to proceed up river would thus be obviated, that the
river would be relieved of pollution by the tides, and the necessity
for constant dredging would be abolished. This &ldquo;barrage
scheme&rdquo; was discussed at considerable length, and its theoretical
advantages were not universally admitted. The scheme included
a railway tunnel beneath the dam, for which, incidentally, a high
military importance was claimed.</p>

<p>In 1904 the Port of London Bill, embodying the recommendations
of the Royal Commission with certain exceptions, was
brought forward, but it was found impossible to carry
<span class="sidenote">Port authorities before 1909.</span>
it through. In 1908, however, the Port of London Act
was passed, and came into force in 1909. This act
provided for the establishment of a Port Authority,
the constitution of which is detailed below, which took over
the entire control of the port, together with the docks and other
property of the several existing companies.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal dock companies, with the docks owned by them,
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>London and India Company.</i>&mdash;This company had amalgamated
all the docks on the north side of the river except the Millwall Docks.
Following the river down from the Tower these docks, with dates of
original opening and existing extent, are&mdash;St Katherine&rsquo;s (1828;
10½ acres), London (1805; 57½ acres), West India, covering the
northern part of the peninsula called the Isle of Dogs (1802; 121½
acres), East India, Blackwall (1806; 38 acres), Royal Victoria and
Albert Docks (1876 and 1880 respectively), parallel with the river
along Bugsby&rsquo;s and Woolwich Reaches, nearly 3 m. in distance
(181 acres) and Tilbury Docks, 25 m. below London Bridge, constructed
in 1886 by the East and West India Docks Company
(65 acres). Tilbury Docks are used by the largest steamers trading
with the port.</p>

<p>2. <i>Millwall Docks</i> (1868), in the south part of the Isle of Dogs, are
36 acres in extent.</p>

<p>3. <i>Surrey Commercial Docks</i>, Rotherhithe (Bermondsey), occupy a
peninsula between the Lower Pool and Limehouse Reach. There
have been docks at Rotherhithe since the middle of the 17th century.
The total area is 176 acres, a large new dock, the Greenland, being
opened in 1904.</p>

<p>The principal railways have wharves and through connexions for
goods traffic, and huge warehouses are attached to the docks. The
custom house stands on the north bank, a short distance from London
Bridge, in Lower Thames Street. It dates from 1817, the body of the
building being by Laing, but the Corinthian façade was added by
Smirke. It includes a museum containing ancient documents and
specimens of articles seized by the customs authorities.</p>

<p>The chief authorities concerned in the government of the Port of
London till 1909 were:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Thames Conservancy.</i>&mdash;For conservancy purposes, regulation
of navigation, removal of obstruction, dredging, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. <i>City Corporation.</i>&mdash;Port sanitary purposes from Teddington
Lock seawards.</p>

<p>3. <i>Trinity House.</i>&mdash;Pilotage, lighting and buoying from London
Bridge seawards.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Watermen&rsquo;s and Lightermen&rsquo;s Company.</i>&mdash;The licensing
authority for watermen and lightermen.</p>

<p>Besides these authorities, the London County Council, the Board
of Trade, the Admiralty, the Metropolitan and City Police, police of
riparian boroughs, Kent and Essex Fisheries Commissioners, all the
dock companies and others played some part in the government
and public services of the port.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Port Authority.</i>&mdash;The Port of London Authority, as constituted
by the act of 1908, is a body corporate consisting of a
chairman, vice-chairman, 17 members elected by payers of dues,
wharfingers and owners of river craft, 1 member elected by
wharfingers exclusively, and 10 members appointed by the
following existing bodies&mdash;Admiralty (one); Board of Trade
(two); London County Council (two from among its own
members and two others); City Corporation (one from among
its own members and one other); Trinity House (one). The
Board of Trade and the County Council must each, under the
act, consult with representatives of labour as to the appointment
of one of the members, in order that labour may be represented on
the Port Authority. The first &ldquo;elected&rdquo; members were actually,
under the act, appointed by the Board of Trade. The undertakings
of the three dock companies mentioned above were
transferred to and vested in the Port Authority, an equivalent
amount of port stock created under the act being issued to each.
The Port Authority has full powers to authorize construction
works. All the rights, powers and duties of the Thames Conservancy,
so far as concerns the Thames below Teddington Lock,
were transferred to the Port Authority under the act, as also
were the powers of the Watermen&rsquo;s Company in respect of the
registration and licensing of vessels, and the regulation of
lightermen and watermen. The Port Authority fixes the port
rates, which, however, must not in any two consecutive years
exceed one-thousandth part of the value of all imports and
exports, or a three-thousandth of the value of goods discharged
from or taken on board vessels not within the premises of a
dock. Preferential dock charges are prohibited and a port fund
established under the act. The authority has powers to borrow
money, but for certain purposes in this connexion, as in other
matters, it can only act subject to the approval of the Board of
Trade.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;The following figures may be quoted for purposes of
comparison at different periods:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Value of Exports of Home Produce</i> (1840), £11,586,037; (1874),
£60,232,118; (1880), £52,600,929; (1902-1905 average), £60,095,294.
Imports (1880), £141,442,907; (1902-1905), £174,059,316. These
figures point to the fact that London is essentially a mart, and
neither is itself, nor is the especial outlet for, a large manufacturing
centre; hence imports greatly exceed exports.</p>

<p><i>Vessels entered and cleared</i> (foreign and colonial trade):&mdash;</p>

<p>In the coastwise trade, in 1881, 38,953 vessels of 4,545,904 tons
entered; in 1895, 43,704 vessels of 6,555,618 tons; but these figures
include vessels trading within the Thames estuary (ports of London,
Rochester, Colchester and Faversham), which later returns do not.
Omitting such vessels, therefore, the number which entered in the
coastwise trade in 1905 was 16,358 of 6,374,832 tons.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Business.</i>&mdash;The City has been indicated as the business centre
of the metropolis. Besides the Royal Exchange, in the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page951" id="page951"></a>951</span>
of which are numerous offices, including &ldquo;Lloyd&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the centre
of the shipping business and marine insurance, there are many
exchanges for special articles. Among these are the Corn
Exchange in Mark Lane, where the privilege of a fair was originally
granted by Edward I.; the Wool Exchange, Coleman
Street; the Coal Exchange, Lower Thames Street; the Shipping
Exchange, Billiter Street; and the auction mart for landed
property in Tokenhouse Yard. The Hop Exchange is across the
river in Southwark. In Mincing Lane are the commercial salerooms.
Besides the Bank of England there are many banking
houses; and the name of Lombard Street, commemorating the
former money dealers of Lombardy, is especially associated
with them. The majority of the banks are members of the
Clearing House, Post Office Court, where a daily exchange of
drafts representing millions of pounds sterling is effected. The
Royal Mint is on Tower Hill. The Stock Exchange is in Capel
Court, and numbers of brokers have their offices in the vicinity
of the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Manufactures and Retail Trade.</i>&mdash;No part of London can be
pointed out as essentially a manufacturing quarter, and there is a
strong tendency for manufacturing firms to establish their factories
outside the metropolis. There are, however, several large breweries,
among which that of Messrs Barclay &amp; Perkins, on the riverside in
Southwark, may be mentioned; engineering works are numerous in
East London by the river, where there are also shipbuilding yards;
the leather industry centres in Bermondsey, the extensive pottery
works of Messrs Doulton are in Lambeth, there are chemical works on
the Lea, and paper-mills on the Wandle. Certain industries (not
confined to factories) have long been associated with particular
localities. Thus, clock-makers and metal-workers are congregated
in Finsbury, especially Clerkenwell and in Islington; Hatton
Garden, near Holborn Viaduct, is a centre for diamond merchants;
cabinet-making is carried on in Bethnal Green, Shoreditch and the
vicinity; and large numbers in the East End are employed in the
match industry. Silk-weaving is still carried on in the district of
Spitalfields (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stepney</a></span>). West of the City certain streets are
essentially connected with certain trades. The old-established
collection of second-hand book-shops in Holywell Street was only
abolished by the widening of the Strand, and a large proportion then
removed to Charing Cross Road. In the Strand, and more especially
in Fleet Street and its offshoots, are found the offices of the majority
of the most important daily newspapers and other journals. Carriage
and motor-car warehouses congregate in Long Acre. In Tottenham
Court Road are the showrooms of several large upholstering and
furnishing firms. Of the streets most frequented on account of their
fashionable shops Bond Street, Regent Street, Oxford Street, Sloane
Street and High Street, Kensington, may be selected. In the East
End and other poor quarters a large trade in second-hand clothing,
flowers and vegetables, and many other commodities is carried on in
the streets on movable stalls by costermongers and hawkers.</p>

<p><i>Markets.</i>&mdash;The City Corporation exercises a control over the
majority of the London markets, which dates from the close of
the 14th century, when dealers were placed under the governance
of the mayor and aldermen. The markets thus controlled
are:</p>

<p><i>Central Markets</i>, Smithfield, for meat, poultry, provisions, fruit,
vegetables, flowers and fish. These extend over a great area north of
Newgate Street and east of Farringdon Road. Beneath them are
extensive underground railway sidings. A market for horses and
cattle existed here at least as early as the time of Henry II.</p>

<p><i>Leadenhall Market</i>, Leadenhall Street, City, for poultry and meat.
This market was in existence before 1411 when it came into the
possession of the City.</p>

<p><i>Billingsgate Market</i>, by the Thames immediately above the
custom house, for fish. Formerly a point of anchorage for small
vessels, it was made a free market in 1699.</p>

<p><i>Smithfield Hay Market.</i></p>

<p><i>Metropolitan Cattle Market</i>, Copenhagen Fields, Islington.</p>

<p><i>Deptford Cattle Market (foreign cattle).</i></p>

<p><i>Spitalfields Market</i> (fruit, vegetables and flowers).</p>

<p><i>Shadwell Market</i> (fish).</p>

<p>Of other markets, the Whitechapel Hay Market and Borough
Market, Southwark, are under the control of trustees; and Woolwich
Market is under the council of that borough. Covent Garden, the
great mart in the west of London for flowers, fruit and vegetables, is
in the hands of private owners. It appears to have been used as a
market early in the 17th century. Scenes of remarkable activity
may be witnessed here and at Billingsgate in the early hours of the
morning when the stock is brought in and the wholesale distributions
are carried on.</p>

<p class="pt2 center">VII. <span class="sc">Government</span></p>

<p><i>Administration before 1888.</i>&mdash;The middle of the 19th century
found the whole local administration of London still of a medieval
character. Moreover, as complete reform had always been
steadily resisted, homogeneity was entirely wanting. Outside
<span class="sidenote">Vestries.</span>
the City itself a system of local government can hardly
be said to have existed. Greater London (in the
sense in which that name might then have been applied) was
governed by the inhabitants of each parish in vestry assembled,
save that in some instances parishes had elected select vestries
under the provisions of the Vestries Act 1831. In neither case
had the vestry powers of town management. To meet the needs
of particular localities, commissioners or trustees having such
powers had been from time to time created by local acts. The
resulting chaos was remarkable. In 1855 these local acts
numbered 250, administered by not less than 300 bodies, and by
a number of persons serving on them computed at 10,448.
These persons were either self-elected, or elected for life, or both,
and therefore in no degree responsible to the ratepayers. There
were two bodies having jurisdiction over the whole metropolis
except the City, namely, the officers appointed under the Metropolitan
Building Act of 1844, and the Metropolitan Commissioners
of Sewers, appointed under the Commissioners of Sewers
Act 1848. Neither body was responsible to the ratepayers.
To remedy this chaotic state of affairs, the Metropolis Management
Act 1855 was passed. Under that act a vestry elected
by the ratepayers of the parish was established for each parish
in the metropolis outside the City. The vestries so elected for
the twenty-two larger parishes were constituted the local
authorities. The fifty-six smaller parishes were grouped together
in fifteen districts, each under a district board, the members
of which were elected by the vestries of the constituent parishes.
<span class="sidenote">Metropolitan Board of Works.</span>
A central body, styled the Metropolitan Board of
Works, having jurisdiction over the whole metropolis
(including the City) was also established, the members
of which were elected by the Common Council of the
City, the vestries and district boards, and the previously established
local board of Woolwich (<i>q.v.</i>). Further the area of the
metropolis for local government purposes was for the first time
defined, being the same as that adopted in the Commissioners of
Sewers Act, which had been taken from the area of the weekly
bills of mortality. The Metropolitan Board of Works was also
given certain powers of supervision over the vestries and district
boards, and superseded the commissioners of sewers as authority
for main drainage. By an act of the same session it became the
central authority for the administration of the Building Acts, and
subsequently had many additional powers and duties conferred
upon it. The vestries and district boards became the authorities
for local drainage, paving, lighting, repairing and maintaining
streets, and for the removal of nuisances, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Acts of 1888 and 1899.</i>&mdash;An objection to the Metropolitan
Board of Works soon became manifest, inasmuch as the system
of election was indirect. Moreover, some of its actions
were open to such suspicion that a royal commission
<span class="sidenote">London County Council.</span>
was appointed to inquire into certain matters connected
with the working of the board. This commission issued
an interim report in 1888 (the final report did not appear until
1891), which disclosed the inefficiency of the board in certain
respects, and also indicated the existence of corruption. Reform
followed immediately. Already in 1884 Sir William Harcourt had
attempted to constitute the metropolis a municipal borough under
the government of a single council. But in 1888 the Local
Government Act, dealing with the area of the metropolis as a
separate county, created the London County Council as the
central administrative body, possessing not only the powers of an
ordinary county council, but also extensive powers of town
management, transferred to it from the abolished Board of Works.
Here, then, was the central body, under their direct control,
which inhabitants of London had hitherto lacked. The question
of subsidiary councils remained to be settled. The wealthier
metropolitan parishes became discontented with the form of
local government to which they remained subject, and in 1897
Kensington and Westminster petitioned to be created boroughs
by the grant of charters under the Municipal Corporation Acts.
These, however, were inapplicable to London, and it was realized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page952" id="page952"></a>952</span>
that the bringing of special legislation to bear on special cases (as
the petition of these two boroughs would have demanded)
<span class="sidenote">Metropolitan boroughs.</span>
would be inexpedient as making against homogeneity.
Instead, the London Government Act of 1899 was
evolved. It brought into existence the twenty-eight
Metropolitan boroughs enumerated at the outset of this
article. The county of London may thus be regarded from the
administrative standpoint as consisting of twenty-nine contiguous
towns, counting the City of London. As regards the distribution
of powers and duties between the County Council and
the Borough Councils, and the constitution and working of each,
the underlying principle may be briefly indicated as giving all
powers and duties which require uniformity of action throughout
the whole of London to the County Council, and powers and duties
that can be locally administered to the Borough Councils.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Summary of Administrative Bodies.</i>&mdash;The administrative bodies
of the County of London may now be summarized:</p>

<p>1. <i>London County Council.</i>&mdash;Consists of 118 councillors, 2 elected
by each parliamentary division (but the City of London elects 4);
and 19 aldermen, with chairman, vice-chairman and deputy-chairman,
elected in council. Triennial elections of councillors by householders
(male and female) on the rate-books. Aldermen hold office
for 6 years.</p>

<p>2. <i>Metropolitan Boroughs.</i>&mdash;Councils consist of a mayor and
aldermen and councillors in proportion as 1 to 6. The commonest
numbers, which cannot be exceeded, are 10 and 60 (see separate
article on each borough). Triennial elections.</p>

<p>3. <i>Corporation of the City of London.</i>&mdash;The legislation of 1855,
1888 and 1899 left the government of the small area of the City in
the hands of an unreformed Corporation. Here at least the medieval
system, in spite of any anomalies with respect to modern conditions,
has resisted reform, and no other municipal body shares the traditions
and peculiar dignity of the City Corporation. This consists of a Lord
Mayor, 26 aldermen and 206 common councilmen, forming the Court
of Common Council, which is the principal administrative body.
Its scope may be briefly indicated as including (<i>a</i>) duties exercised
elsewhere by the Borough Councils, and by the London County
Council (although that body is by no means powerless within the
City boundaries); and (<i>b</i>) peculiar duties such as control of markets
and police. The election of common councilmen, whose institution
dates from the reign of Edward I., takes place annually, the electors
being the ratepayers, divided among the twenty-five wards of the
City. An alderman (<i>q.v.</i>) of each ward (save that the wards of
Cripplegate within and without, share one) is elected for life. The
Lord Mayor (<i>q.v.</i>) is elected by the Court of Aldermen from two
aldermen nominated in the Court of Common Hall by the Livery,
an electorate drawn from the members of the ancient trade gilds or
Livery Companies (<i>q.v.</i>), which, through their control over the
several trades or manufactures, had formerly an influence over the
government of the city which from the time of Edward III. was
paramount.</p>

<p><i>Non-administrative Arrangements.</i>&mdash;The Local Government Act
of 1888 dealt with the metropolis for non-administrative purposes
as it did for administrative, that is to say, as a separate county.
The arrangements of quarter-sessions, justices, coroners, sheriffs,
&amp;c., were thus brought into line with other counties, except in so far
as the ordinary organization is modified by the existence of the
central criminal court, the metropolitan police, police courts and
magistrates, and a paid chairman of quarter-sessions. The powers
of the governing body of the City, moreover, are as peculiar in this
direction as in that of municipal administration, and the act left
the City as a county of a city practically unchanged. Thus the Lord
Mayor and aldermen possess judicial authority, and the police of
London are divided into two separate bodies, the Metropolitan and
the City Police (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Police</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<p>The chief courts for the trial of criminal cases are the Central
Criminal Court and the Court of Quarter-sessions. The Central
Criminal Court, taking the place of the provincial
Assizes, was established by an act of 1834. There are
<span class="sidenote">Courts.</span>
twelve sessions annually, under the Lord Mayor, aldermen and
judges. They were formerly held in the &ldquo;Old Bailey&rdquo; sessions-house,
but a fine new building from designs of E. W. Mountford
took the place of this in 1906. Quarter-sessions for the county
of London are held thirty-six times annually, for the north side
of the Thames at the Sessions-house in Clerkenwell (Finsbury)
and for the south side at that in Newington Causeway, Southwark.
For judicial purposes Westminster was merged with the
county of London in 1889, and the Liberty of the Tower was
abolished in 1894. The separate court of the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen is held at the Guildhall. The Metropolitan police
courts are fourteen in number, namely&mdash;Bow Street, Covent
Garden; Clerkenwell; Great Marlborough Street (Westminster);
Greenwich and Woolwich; Lambeth; Marylebone; North
London, Stoke Newington Road; Southwark; South Western,
Lavender Hill (Battersea); Thames, Arbour Street East (Stepney);
West Ham; West London, Vernon Street (Fulham);
Westminster, Vincent Square; Worship Street (Shoreditch).
The police courts of the City are held at the Mansion House,
the Lord Mayor or an alderman sitting as magistrate, and at the
Guildhall, where the aldermen preside in rotation. The prisons
within the metropolis are Brixton, Holloway, Pentonville,
Wandsworth and Wormwood Scrubbs. In the county of London
there are 12 coroners&rsquo; districts, 19 petty sessional divisions (the
City forming a separate one) and 13 county court districts (the
City forming a separate one). The boundaries of these divisions
do not in any way correspond with each other, or with the police
divisions, or with the borough or parish boundaries. The registration
county of London coincides with the administrative
county.</p>

<p><i>Parliamentary Representation.</i>&mdash;The London Government Act
contains a saving clause by which &ldquo;nothing in or done under this
act shall be construed as altering the limits of any parliamentary
borough or parliamentary county.&rdquo; The parliamentary boroughs
are thus in many cases named and bounded differently from the
metropolitan boroughs. The parliamentary arrangements of
each metropolitan borough are indicated in the separate articles
on the boroughs. In the following list the boroughs which
extend outside the administrative county of London are noted.
Each division of each borough, or each borough where not
divided, returns one member, save that the City of London
returns two members.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>North of the Thames.</i> (1) Bethnal Green&mdash;<i>Divs.</i>: North-eastern,
South-western. (2) Chelsea (detached portion in administrative
county of Middlesex, Kensal Town). (3) Finsbury

Wandsworth. (10) Woolwich.</p>

<p>Part of the Wimbledon parliamentary division of Surrey is in the
metropolitan borough of Wandsworth.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Ecclesiastical Divisions and Denominations.</i>&mdash;London north of
the Thames is within the Church of England bishopric of London,
the bishop&rsquo;s palace being at Fulham. In this diocese, which
covers nearly the whole of Middlesex and a very small portion of
Hertfordshire, are the suffragan bishoprics of Islington, Kensington
and Stepney. The bishopric of Southwark was created
in 1904, having been previously a suffragan bishopric in the
diocese of Rochester. The county contains 612 ecclesiastical
parishes. Westminster is the seat of the Roman Catholic
archbishopric in England, and Southwark is a bishopric. Among
the numerous chapels of dissenting bodies there may be mentioned
the City Temple, Congregational, on Holborn Viaduct;
the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Baptist, in Southwark, the creation
of which was the outcome of the labours of the famous preacher
Charles Spurgeon (d. 1892); and Wesley&rsquo;s Chapel, City Road, in
the graveyard of which is the tomb of John Wesley; his house,
which adjoins the chapel, being open as a memorial museum.
In 1903 the Wesleyans acquired the site of the Royal Aquarium,
near Westminster Abbey, for the erection of a central hall.
The Great Synagogue of the Jews is in St James&rsquo; Place, Aldgate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page953" id="page953"></a>953</span>
The headquarters of the Salvation Army are in Queen Victoria
Street, City. There are numerous foreign churches, among
which may be mentioned the French Protestant churches in
Monmouth Road, Bayswater and Soho Square; the Greek church
of St Sophia, Moscow Road, Bayswater; and the German
Evangelical church in Montpelier Place, Brompton Road,
opened in 1904.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In addition to the provisions that have been mentioned above
(Section VII.), the London Government Act 1899 simplified administration
in two respects. The duties of overseers in London had
been performed by most diverse bodies. In some parishes overseers
were appointed in the ordinary manner; in others the vestry, by
local acts and by orders under the Local Government Act 1894, was
appointed to act as, or empowered to appoint, overseers, whilst in
Chelsea the guardians acted as overseers. The act of 1899 swept
away all these distinctions, and constituted the new borough councils
in every case the overseers for every parish within their respective
boroughs, except that the town clerk of each borough performs the
duties of overseers with respect to the registration of electors.<a name="fa4f" id="fa4f" href="#ft4f"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
Again, with regard to rates, there were in all cases three different
rates leviable in each parish&mdash;the poor rate, the general rate and the
sewers rate&mdash;whilst in many parishes in addition there was a separate
lighting rate. From the sewers rate and lighting rate, land, as
opposed to buildings, was entitled to certain exemptions. Under the
act of 1899 all these rates are consolidated into a single rate, called
the general rate, which is assessed, made, collected and levied as the
poor rate, but the interests of persons previously entitled to exemptions
are safeguarded. Further, every precept sent by an
authority in London for the purpose of obtaining money (these
authorities include the London County Council, the receiver of the
Metropolitan Police, the Central Unemployed Body and the Boards
of Guardians) which has ultimately to be raised out of a rate within a
borough is sent direct to the council of the borough instead of
filtering through other authorities before reaching the overseers.
The only exceptions to this rule are: (1) precepts issued by the
local government board for raising the sums to be contributed to
the metropolitan common poor fund; and (2) precepts issued by
poor law authorities representing two or more poor-law unions; in
both these cases the precept has of necessity to be first sent to the
guardians. The metropolitan borough councils make one general
rate, which includes the amount necessary to meet their own expenditure,
as well as to meet the demands of the various precepting
authorities. There was thus raised in the year 1906-1907 a sum of
£15,393,956 (in 1898-1899 the amount was £10,401,441); of this
£11,012,424 was for central rates, which was subdivided into
£7,930,275 for county services and £3,082,149 for local services,
leaving a balance of £4,381,532, strictly local rates. The total local
expenditure of London for the year 1906-1907 was £24,703,087 (in
1898-1899 it was only £14,768,757), the balance of £9,761,734 being
made up by receipts-in-aid and imperial subventions. This expenditure
was divided among the following bodies:</p>

<p class="noind">The total expenditure was equal to a rate in the pound of 11s. 4.4d.; the
actual amount raised in rates was equivalent to a rate of 7s. 1.0d.,
receipts-in-aid were equivalent to a rate of 3s. 2.5d., and imperial
subventions to a rate of 1s. 3.4d. Practically the whole amount
contributed towards the support of public local expenditure, and
a considerable amount of that contributed to public national
expenditure is based on the estimated annual value of the immovable
property situated within the county of London, which in 1876
was £23,240,070; in 1886 £30,716,719; in 1896 £35,793,672; and
in 1909 £44,666,651. The produce of a penny rate was, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page954" id="page954"></a>954</span>
metropolitan police district in 1908-1909, £226,739, and in the county
of London (excluding the City) £161,806. A complete re-valuation of
properties in the county of London is made every five years, valuation
lists being prepared in duplicate by the borough councils acting as
overseers of the parishes in their respective boroughs. They are
revised by statutory assessment committees, who hear any objections
by ratepayers against their valuation. These lists when revised are
sent to the clerk of the County Council, who publishes the totals.
By the Metropolitan Poor Act 1867, the metropolitan common poor
fund, to which each union in London contributes in proportion to its
rateable value, was established. Out of this fund certain expenses of
guardians in connexion with the maintenance of indoor paupers and
lunatics, the salaries of officers, the maintenance of children in poor-law
schools, valuation, vaccination, registration, &amp;c., are paid. The
payments amounted in 1906-1907 to £1,662,942. Under the Local
Government Act 1888, the London County Council makes grants to
boards of guardians, sanitary authorities and overseers in London in
respect of certain services. This grant is in lieu of the grants formerly
made out of the exchequer grant in aid of local rates, and amounted
in 1906-1907 to £619,489. Finally, in 1894, the fund called the
Equalization Fund was established. This fund is raised by the rate
of 6d. in the pound on the assessable value of the county of London, and
redistributed among the boroughs in proportion to their population.
It amounted in 1906-1907 to £1,094,946. But, in spite of attempts
at equalization, rates remain very unequal in London, and varied in
1908 from 6s. 2d. in St Anne&rsquo;s, Westminster, to 11s. 6d. in Poplar.
The London County Council levied in 1909-1910 to meet its estimated
expenditure for the year a total rate of 36.75d.; 14.50d. of this
was for general county purposes, 19.75d. for education purposes and
2.50d. for special county purposes. The preceding tables show the
estimated income and expenditure of the London County Council
for 1909-1910.</p>

<p>Besides the annual expenditure of the various authorities large
sums have been borrowed to defray the cost of works of a permanent
nature. The debt of London, like that of other municipalities, has
considerably increased and shows a tendency to go on increasing,
although certain safeguards against too ready borrowing have been
imposed. Every local authority has to obtain the sanction of some
higher authority before raising a loan, and there are in addition
certain statutory limits of borrowing. Metropolitan borough
councils have to obtain the sanction of the Local Government Board
to loans for baths, washhouses, public libraries, sanitary conveniences
and certain other purposes under the Public Health Acts; for
cemeteries the sanction of the Treasury is required, and for all other
purposes that of the London County Council; poor law authorities,
the metropolitan asylums board, the metropolitan water board and
the central (unemployed) body require the sanction of the Local
Government Board; the receiver for the metropolitan police district
that of the Home Office, and the London County Council that of
parliament and the Treasury. The following table gives the net loans

<p class="pt2 center">IX. <span class="sc">History</span></p>

<p>1. <i>British and Roman to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 449.</i>&mdash;There is practically no
record of British London, and considerable difference of opinion
exists among antiquaries as to its very existence. Bishop
Stillingfleet held that London was of Roman foundation and
not older than the time of Claudius (<i>Origines Brit.</i>, 1685, p. 43);
and Dr Guest affirmed that the notion of a British town having
&ldquo;preceded the Roman camp has no foundation to rest upon&rdquo;
(<i>Archaeological Journal</i>, xxiii. 180). J. R. Green expressed the
same opinion in <i>The Making of England</i> (p. 101). On the other
side Kemble held that it was difficult to believe that Cair Lunden
was an unimportant place even in Caesar&rsquo;s day (<i>Saxons in
England</i>, ii. 266); and Thomas Lewin believed that London
had attained prosperity before the Romans came; and held
that it was probably the capital of Cassivellaunus, which was
taken and sacked by Julius Caesar (<i>Archaeologia</i>, xl. 59). The
origin of London will probably always remain a subject of
dispute for want of decisive facts.</p>

<p>The strongest reason for believing in a British London is to be
found in the name, which is undoubtedly Celtic, adopted with
little alteration by the Romans. It is also difficult to believe
that Londinium had come to be the important commercial centre
described by Tacitus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 61) if it had only been founded a few
years before the conquest of Claudius.</p>

<p>The discovery by General Pitt Rivers in 1867 of the remains of
pile dwellings both on the north and on the south of the Thames
gives ground for an argument of some force in favour of the date
of the foundation of London having been before the Roman
occupation of Britain. Of Roman London we possess so many
remains that its appearance can be conjectured with little
difficulty.</p>

<p>During the centuries when Britain was occupied by the
Romans (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 43-409) there was ample time for cities to grow up
from small beginnings, to overflow their borders and to be more
than once rebuilt. The earliest Roman London must have been
a comparatively small place, but it probably contained a military
fort of some kind intended to cover the passage of the river.</p>

<p>The Roman general Paulinus Suetonius, after marching
rapidly from Wales to put down a serious insurrection, found
Londinium unfitted for a base of military operations,
and therefore left the place to the mercy of Boadicea,
<span class="sidenote">Extent of Roman London.</span>
who entirely destroyed it, and killed the inhabitants.
After this the need of fortifying Londinium must have
been apparent, and a walled city of small dimensions arose soon
after the defeat of the British queen. The earliest Roman city
probably extended as far as Tower Hill on the east, and there is
reason to believe that it did not include any ground to the west
of Leadenhall. The excavations at the latter place in 1881
threw great light upon the early history of London. The foundation
walls of a basilica were discovered, and from the time
when that was built until the present day the ground has always
been devoted to public uses. How far north the first wall was
placed it is difficult to guess. One help towards a settlement
of the question may be found in the discovery of burial places.
As it was illegal in Roman times to bury within the walls, we
are forced to the conclusion that the places where these sepulchral
remains have been found were at one time extramural. Now
no such remains have been found between Gracechurch Street
and the Tower. The northern wall was placed by Roach Smith
somewhere along the course of Cornhill and Leadenhall Street.
The second extension of the city westwards was probably to
Wallbrook.</p>

<p>In the latest or third Roman enclosure the line of the wall
ran straight from the Tower to Aldgate, where it bent round
somewhat to Bishopsgate. On the east it was bordered by the
district subsequently called the Minories and Houndsditch.
The line from Bishopsgate ran eastward to St Giles&rsquo;s churchyard
(Cripplegate), where it turned to the south as far as Falcon
square; again westerly by Aldersgate round the site of the
Greyfriars (afterwards Christ&rsquo;s Hospital) towards Giltspur
Street, then south by the Old Bailey to Ludgate, and then down
to the Thames, where Dr Edwin Freshfield suggests that a
Roman fortress stood on the site of Baynard&rsquo;s Castle. This
is most probable, because the Romans naturally required a
special protection on the river at the west as well as at the east.
So in later times when William the Conqueror planned the
Tower he gave the site at the western extremity to his follower
Ralph Baynard, where was erected the stronghold known as
Baynard&rsquo;s Castle. Roach Smith pointed out that the enclosure
indicated above gives dimensions far greater than those of any
other town in Britain. There can be no doubt that within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page955" id="page955"></a>955</span>
walls there was originally much unoccupied space, for with the
single exception of the larger circuit south of Ludgate, up to
where the river Fleet ran, made in 1276 for the benefit of the
Black Friars, the line of the walls, planned by the later Romans,
remained complete until the Great Fire (1666). The Thames
formed the natural barrier on the south, but the Romans do not
appear to have been content with this protection, for they
built a wall here in addition, which remained for several centuries.
Portions of this wall have been discovered at various times.</p>

<p>It is difficult even to guess when the third wall was erected.
The emperor Theodosius came to London from Boulogne to
mature his plan for the restoration of the tranquillity of the
province. As Theodosius is said to have left Britain in a sound
and secure condition it has been suggested that to him was
due the wall of the later Londinium, but there is little or no
evidence for this opinion, and according to an old tradition
Constantine the Great walled the city at the request of his mother
Helena, presumed to be a native of Britain. There is, however,
some evidence in favour of the supposition that the wall was
built at a much earlier date. It is not improbable that early
in the 2nd century the wall was finished at the west portion and
enclosed a cemetery near Newgate. Sir William Tite, in describing
a tessellated pavement found in 1854 on the site of the
Excise Office (Bishopsgate Street), expresses the opinion that
the finished character of the pavement points to a period of
security and wealth, and fixes on the reign of Hadrian (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 117-138),
to which the silver coin found on the floor belongs, as the
date of its foundation.</p>

<p>The historians of the Roman Empire have left us some particulars
of the visits of emperors and generals to Britain, but
little or nothing about what happened in London, and we should
be more ignorant than we are of the condition of Londinium
if it had not been that a large number of excavations have been
made in various parts of the city which have disclosed a considerable
amount of its early history. From these remains
we may guess that London was a handsome city in the reign
of Hadrian, and probably then in as great a position of importance
as it ever attained. This being so, there seems to
be reason in attributing the completed walls to this period.</p>

<p>The persistence of the relics of the walls of London is one
of the most remarkable facts of history. Pieces of the wall
are to be seen in various parts of the city, and are
frequently found when extensive excavations are
<span class="sidenote">Remains of Roman Wall.</span>
made for new buildings. In some places where the
Roman wall is not to be seen there still exist pieces
of the old wall that stand upon Roman foundations. In Amen
Court, where the residences of canons of St Paul&rsquo;s and the
later houses of the minor canons are situated, there stretches
such a piece of wall, dividing the gardens of the Court from
the Old Bailey. Of the few accessible fragments of the Roman
wall still existing special mention may be made of the bastion
in the churchyard of St Giles&rsquo;s, Cripplegate; a little farther
west is a small fragment in St Martin&rsquo;s Court, Ludgate Hill
(opposite the Old Bailey), but the best specimen can be seen
near Tower Hill just out of George Street, Trinity Square.
Early in the 20th century a fragment nearly 40 ft. long, together
with the base of a bastion, was brought to light in digging for the
foundation of some large warehouses in Camomile Street, at
a depth of 10 ft. below the level of the present street. A considerable
portion of the old wall was laid bare by the excavations
for the new Post Office in St Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand. From a comparison
of these fragments with the descriptions of Woodward,
Maitland and others, who in the early part of the 18th century
examined portions of the wall still standing, we learn that the
wall was from 9 to 12 ft. thick, and formed of a core of rough
rubble cemented together with mortar (containing much coarse
gravel) of extraordinary hardness and tenacity, and a facing
for the most part of stone&mdash;Kentish rag, freestone or ironstone&mdash;but
occasionally of flints; about 2 ft. apart are double layers
of tiles or bricks which serve as bonding courses. The wall
appears to have been about 20 ft. high, the towers from 40 to
50 ft., but when described only the base was Roman. Upon
that was raised a wall of rough rubble rudely faced with stone
and flint, evidently a medieval work and about 2½ ft. thick;
then succeeded a portion wholly of brick, terminating in battlements
topped with copings of stone.</p>

<p>Although the course of the later Roman walls is clear, we
do not know with any certainty the position of the Roman
gates. They were not the same as the medieval gates which
have left the record of their names in modern London
<span class="sidenote">Gates and buildings.</span>
nomenclature. It follows, therefore, that the main
streets also are not in line with the Roman ways,
except perhaps in a few instances. Many ineffectual attempts
have been made to connect the Watling street in the city with
the great Roman road so named in medieval times. The name
of the small street is evidently a corruption, and in the valuable
Report of the MSS. of the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&rsquo;s (<i>Ninth
Report of the Historical MSS. Commission</i>, Appendix, p. 4) the
original name is given as &ldquo;Atheling Street,&rdquo; and instances of
this spelling are common in the 13th century. The form Watling
Street seems to occur first in 1307. Stow spells it Watheling
Street (Kingsford&rsquo;s edition of Stow&rsquo;s <i>Survey</i>, 1908, vol. ii. p. 352).
Sir William Tite gave reasons for believing that Bishopsgate
Street was not a Roman thoroughfare, and in the excavations
at Leadenhall the basilica to which allusion has already been
made was found apparently crossing the present thoroughfare
of Gracechurch Street. Tite also agreed with Dr Stukeley&rsquo;s
suggestion that on the site of the Mansion House (formerly
Stocks Market) stood the Roman forum, and he states that a
line drawn from that spot as a centre would pass by the pavements
found on the site of the Excise Office. Besides the forum
Stukeley suggested the sites of seven other buildings&mdash;the <i>Arx
Palatina</i> guarding the south-eastern angle of the city where the
Tower now stands, the grove and temple of Diana on the site
of St Paul&rsquo;s, &amp;c. No traces of any of these buildings have been
found, and they are therefore purely conjectural. Stukeley&rsquo;s
industrious researches into the history of Roman London cannot
be said to have any particular value, although at one time they
enjoyed considerable vogue. As to the Temple of Diana, Sir
Christopher Wren formed an opinion strongly adverse to the old
tradition of its existence (<i>Parentalia</i>, p. 266). Although we
know that the Christian church was established in Britain during
the later period of the Roman domination, there is little to be
learnt respecting it, and the bishop Restitutus, who is said to
have attended an Ecclesiastical Council, is a somewhat mythical
character. In respect to the discovery of the position of the
Roman gates, the true date of the <i>Antonini Itinerarium</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) is
of great importance, as it will be seen from it that Londinium
was either a starting-point or a terminus in nearly half the routes
described in the portion relating to Britain. This would be
remarkable if the work dated back to the 2nd century. Probably
in the later, as in the earlier time, Londinium had the usual
four gates of a Roman city, with the main roads to them. The
one on the east was doubtless situated near where Aldgate
afterwards stood. On the south the entrance to Londinium
must always have been near where London Bridge was subsequently
built. On the west the gate could not have been far
from the place afterwards occupied by Newgate. As to Ludgate
there is reason to believe that if there was an opening there in
Roman times it was merely a postern. On the north the gate
may have been near Bishopsgate or at Aldersgate. If we take
from the <i>Itinerary</i> the last station before Londinium in all the
routes we shall be able to obtain some idea of the position of the
gate entered from each route by drawing a line on the map of
London to the nearest point. Ammianus Marcellinus (about
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 390) speaks twice of Londinium as an ancient town to
which the honourable title of Augusta had been accorded.
Some writers have been under the misapprehension that this
name for a time superseded that of Londinium. The anonymous
Chorographer of Ravenna calls the place Londinium Augusta,
and doubtless this was the form adopted.</p>

<p>The most interesting Roman relic is &ldquo;London Stone.&rdquo; It has
generally been supposed to be a &ldquo;milliarium&rdquo; or central point
for measuring distances, but Sir Christopher Wren believed it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page956" id="page956"></a>956</span>
was part of some more considerable monuments in the forum
<span class="sidenote">London Stone.</span>
(<i>Parentalia</i>, pp. 265, 266). Holinshed (who was followed by
Shakespeare in <i>2 Henry VI.</i>, act 4 sc. 6) tells us that
when Cade, in 1450, forced his way into London, he first
of all proceeded to London Stone, and having struck his
sword upon it, said in reference to himself and in explanation of
his own action, &ldquo;Now is Mortimer lord of this city.&rdquo; Mr H. C.
Coote, in a paper published in the <i>Trans. London and Middlesex
Arch. Soc.</i> for 1878, points out that this act meant something
to the mob who followed the rebel chief, and was not a piece
of foolish acting. Mr Laurence Gomme (<i>Primitive Folk-Moots</i>,
pp. 155, 156) takes up the matter at this point, and places the
tradition implied by Cade&rsquo;s significant action as belonging to
times when the London Stone was, as other great stones were,
the place where the suitors of an open-air assembly were accustomed
to gather together and to legislate for the government
of the city. Corroborative facts have been gathered from other
parts of the country, and, although more evidence is required,
such as we have is strongly in favour of the supposition that the
London Stone is a prehistoric monument.</p>

<p>One of the most important questions in the history of London
that requires settlement is the date of the building of the first
bridge, that is whether it was constructed by Britons
or by Romans. If the Britons had not already made
<span class="sidenote">The first London Bridge.</span>
the bridge before the Romans arrived it must have
been one of the first Roman works. As long as there
was no bridge to join the north and south banks of the Thames
the great object of Roman rule remained unfulfilled. This
object was the completion of a system of roads connecting all
parts of the Empire with Rome.</p>

<p>Dio Cassius, who lived in the early part of the 3rd century
(<i>Hist. Rom.</i> lib. lx. c. 20), states that there was a bridge over the
Thames at the time of the invasion of Claudius (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 43), but he
places it a little above the mouth of the river (&ldquo;higher up&rdquo;).
The position is vague, but the mouth of the Thames in these
early times may be considered as not far from the present
position of London Bridge. Sir George Airy held that this
bridge was not far from the site of London Bridge (<i>Proceedings
of Institut. Civil Engineers</i>, xlix. 120), but Dr Guest was not
prepared to allow that the Britons were able to construct a
bridge over a tidal river such as the Thames, some 300 yds. wide,
with a difference of level at high and low water of nearly 20 ft.
He therefore suggested that the bridge was constructed over
the marshy valley of the Lea, probably near Stratford. It needs
some temerity to differ from so great an authority as Dr Guest,
but it strikes one as surprising that, having accepted the fact
of a bridge made by the Britons, he should deny that these
Britons possessed a town or village in the place to which he
supposes that Aulus Plautius retired.</p>

<p>As the Welsh word for &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; is &ldquo;pont,&rdquo; and this was taken
directly from the Latin, the inference is almost conclusive that
the Britons acquired their knowledge of bridges from the Romans.
Looking at the stage of culture which the Britons had probably
reached, it would further be a natural inference that there was no
such thing as a bridge anywhere in Britain before the Roman
occupation; but, if Dion&rsquo;s statement is correct, it may be
suggested as a possible explanation that the increased intercourse
with Gaul during the hundred years that elapsed between Julius
Caesar&rsquo;s raids and Claudius Caesar&rsquo;s invasion may have led to
the construction of a bridge of some kind across the Thames at
this point, through the influence and under the guidance of
Roman traders and engineers. If so, the word &ldquo;pont&rdquo; may
have been borrowed by the Britons before the commencement
of the Roman occupation. Much stronger are the reasons for
believing that there was a bridge in Roman times. Remains
of Roman villas are found in Southwark, which was evidently
a portion of Londinium, and it therefore hardly seems likely
that a bridge-building people such as the Romans would remain
contented with a ferry. Roach Smith is a strong advocate for the
bridge, and remarks, &ldquo;It would naturally be erected somewhere
in the direct line of road into Kent, which I cannot but think
pointed towards the site of Old London Bridge, both from its
central situation, from the general absence of the foundations
of buildings in the approaches on the northern side, and from
discoveries recently made in the Thames on the line of the old
bridge&rdquo; (<i>Archaeologia</i>, xxix. 160). Smith has, however, still
stronger arguments, which he states as follows: &ldquo;Throughout
the entire line of the old bridge, the bed of the river was found
to contain ancient wooden piles; and when these piles, subsequently
to the erection of the new bridge, were pulled up to
deepen the channel of the river, many thousands of Roman coins,
with abundance of broken Roman tiles and pottery, were
discovered, and immediately beneath some of the central piles
brass medallions of Aurelius, Faustina and Commodus. All
these remains are indicative of a bridge. The enormous quantities
of Roman coins may be accounted for by consideration of
the well-known practice of the Romans to make these imperishable
monuments subservient towards perpetuating the memory,
not only of their conquests, but also of those public works which
were the natural result of their successes in remote parts of the
world. They may have been deposited either upon the building
or repairs of the bridge, as well as upon the accession of a new
emperor&rdquo; (<i>Archaeological Journal</i>, i. 113).</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 5th century the Roman legions left
Britain, and the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> gives the exact date, stating
that never since <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 409 &ldquo;have the Romans ruled in Britain&rdquo;&mdash;the
chronicler setting down the Roman sway at 470 winters
and dating from Julius Caesar&rsquo;s invasion. We learn that in
the year 418 &ldquo;the Romans collected all the treasures that
were in Britain, and hid some of them in the earth, that no man
might afterwards find them, and conveyed some with them
into Gaul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2. <i>Saxon</i> (449-1066).&mdash;We are informed in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>
that about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 449 or 450 the invaders settled in Britain, and
in 457 Hengist and Aesc fought against the Britons at Crayford,
driving them out of Kent. The vanquished fled to London in
terror and apparently found a shelter there. After this entry
there is no further mention of London in the <i>Chronicle</i> for a
century and a half. This silence has been taken by some
historians of weight to imply that London practically ceased
to exist. Dr Guest asserted &ldquo;that good reason may be given
for the belief that even London itself for a while lay desolate
and uninhabited&rdquo; (<i>Archaeological Journal</i>, xix. 219). J. R.
Green and Mr Loftie strongly supported this view, and in Sir
Walter Besant&rsquo;s <i>Early London</i> (1908) the idea of the desolation
of the city is taken for granted.</p>

<p>In answer to this contention it may be said that, although
the silence of the <i>Chronicle</i> is difficult to understand, it is almost
impossible to believe that the very existence of the most important
city in the country could suddenly cease and the inhabitants
disappear without some special notice. Battles and
scenes of destruction are so fully described in other instances
that one must believe that when nothing is related nothing
special occurred. No doubt the coming of the Saxons, which
entirely changed the condition of the country, must have greatly
injured trade, but although there was not the same freedom of
access to the roads, the Londoners had the highway of the river
at their doors. Although the Saxons hated towns and refused
to settle in London, they may have allowed the original inhabitants
to continue their trade on condition that they received
some share of the profits or a tribute. The only question
really is whether London being an exceptional city received
exceptional treatment.</p>

<p>Along the banks of the Thames are several small havens
whose names have remained to us, such as Rotherhithe, Lambhith
<span class="sidenote">Saxon Settlement.</span>
(Lambeth), Chelchith (Chelsea), &amp;c., and it is not
unlikely that the Saxons, who would not settle in the
city itself, associated themselves with these small
open spots. Places were thus founded over a large
space which otherwise might have remained unsettled.</p>

<p>If what is here suggested really occurred it may be that this
separation of London from the surrounding country originated
the remarkable position of London with its unparalleled privileges,
which were continued for many centuries and kept it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page957" id="page957"></a>957</span>
only the leader among cities but distinct from all others. Laurence
Gomme, in <i>The Governance of London</i> (1907), opposes the
view that the city was for a time left deserted (a view which,
it may be remarked, is a comparatively modern one, probably
originating with Dr Guest). H. C. Coote in his <i>Romans of
Britain</i> elaborated a description of the survival of Roman
influence in English institutions, but his views did not obtain
much support from London historians. Mr Gomme&rsquo;s contention
is to some extent a modification of Mr Coote&rsquo;s view,
but it is original in the illustrations that give it force. Londinium
was a Roman city, and (as in the case of all such cities) was
formed on the model of ancient Rome. It may therefore be
expected to retain evidence of the existence of a Pomoerium
and Territorium as at Rome. The Pomoerium marked the
unbuilt space around the walls. Gomme refers to an open
space outside the western wall of Dorchester still called the
Pummery as an indication of the Pomoerium in that place;
and he considers that the name of Mile End, situated 1 m. from
Aldgate and the city walls, marks the extent of the open space
around the walls of London known as the Pomoerium. This
fact throws a curious light upon the growth of the &ldquo;Liberties.&rdquo;
It has always been a puzzle that no note exists of the first
institution of these liberties. If this open space was from the
<span class="sidenote">Origin of the Liberties.</span>
earliest times attached to the city there would be no
need when it was built upon for any special act to be
passed for its inclusion in London. &ldquo;The <i>Territorium</i>
of the city was its special property, and it extended
as far as the limits of the territorium of the nearest Roman
city or as near thereto as the natural boundaries.&rdquo; This explains
the position of Middlesex in relation to London. In connexion
with these two features of a Roman city supposed to be found
in Ancient London the author argues for the continuity of the
city through the changes of Roman and Saxon dominion.</p>

<p>One of the most striking illustrations of the probable continuity
of London history is to be found in the contrast between
York and London. This is only alluded to in Gomme&rsquo;s book,
but it is elaborated in an article in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> (November
1906). These two were the chief Roman cities in Britain,
one in the north and the other in the south. They are both
equally good examples of important cities under Roman domination.
York was conquered and occupied by the Saxons, and
there not only are the results of English settlement clear but
all records of Roman government were destroyed. In London
the Saxon stood outside the government for centuries, and
the acceptance of the Roman survival explains much that is
otherwise unintelligible.</p>

<p>Gomme finds important evidence of the independence of
London in the existence of a merchant law which was opposed
to Anglo-Saxon law. He reprints and discusses the
celebrated <i>Judicia Civitatis Lundoniae</i> of King Æthelstan&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Independence of London.</span>
reign&mdash;&ldquo;the ordinance&rdquo; (as it declares itself)
&ldquo;which the bishop and the reeves belonging to London
have ordained.&rdquo; He holds that the Londoners passed &ldquo;their
own laws by their own citizens without reference to the king
at all,&rdquo; and in the present case of a king who according to Kemble
&ldquo;had carried the influence of the crown to an extent unexampled
in any of his predecessors.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;What happened
afterwards was evidently this: that the code passed by the
Londoners was sent to the king for him to extend its application
throughout the kingdom, and this is done by the eleventh
section.&rdquo; The view originated by Gomme certainly explains
many difficulties in the history of the transition from Roman
to English London, which have hitherto been overlooked by
historians.</p>

<p>When the city is next referred to in the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> it
appears to have been inhabited by a population of heathens.
Under the date 604 we read: &ldquo;This year Augustine
consecrated two bishops: Mellitus and Justus. He
<span class="sidenote">Arrival of Christianity.</span>
sent Mellitus to preach baptism to the East Saxons,
whose king was called Sebert, son of Ricole the sister
of Æthelbert, and whom Æthelbert had then appointed king.
And Æthelbert gave Mellitus a bishop&rsquo;s see in Lundenevic and
to Justus he gave Rochester, which is twenty-four miles from
Canterbury.&rdquo; The Christianity of the Londoners was of an
unsatisfactory character, for, after the death of Sebert, his sons
who were heathens stirred up the multitude to drive out their
bishop. Mellitus became archbishop of Canterbury, and London
relapsed into heathenism. In this, the earliest period of Saxon
history recorded, there appears to be no relic of the Christianity
of the Britons, which at one time was well in evidence. What
became of the cathedral which we may suppose to have existed
in London during the later Roman period we cannot tell, but
we may guess that it was destroyed by the heathen Saxons.
Bede records that the church of St Paul was built by Æthelbert,
and from that time to this a cathedral dedicated to St Paul has
stood upon the hill looking down on Ludgate.</p>

<p>After the driving out of Mellitus London remained without a
bishop until the year 656, when Cedda, brother of St Chad of
Lichfield, was invited to London by Sigebert, who had been
converted to Christianity by Finan, bishop of the Northumbrians.
Cedda was consecrated bishop of the East Saxons by Finan and
held the see till his death on the 26th of October 664. He was
succeeded by Wini, bishop of Winchester, and then came
Earconuald (or St Erkenwald), whose shrine was one of the chief
glories of old St Paul&rsquo;s. He died on the 30th of April 693, a
day which was kept in memory in his cathedral for centuries
by special offices. The list of bishops from Cedda to William
(who is addressed in the Conqueror&rsquo;s Charter) is long, and each
bishop apparently held a position of great importance in the
government of the city.</p>

<p>In the 7th century the city seems to have settled down into
a prosperous place and to have been peopled by merchants of
many nationalities. We learn that at this time it was
the great mart of slaves. It was in the fullest sense a
<span class="sidenote">Danish Invasions.</span>
free-trading town; neutral to a certain extent between
the kingdoms around, although the most powerful of the kings
conquered their feebler neighbours. During the 8th century,
when a more settled condition of life became possible, the trade
and commerce of London increased in volume and prosperity. A
change, however, came about towards the end of the century,
when the Scandinavian freebooters known as Danes began to
harry the coasts. The Saxons had become law-abiding, and the
fierce Danes treated them in the same way as in former days they
had treated the Britons. In 871 the chronicler affirms that
Alfred fought nine great battles against the Danes in the kingdom
south of the Thames, and that the West Saxons made peace with
them. In the next year the Danes went from Reading to London,
and there took up their winter quarters. Then the Mercians
made peace with them. In 886 Alfred overcame the Danes,
restored London to its inhabitants, rebuilt its walls, reannexed
the city to Mercia, and committed it to Ethelred, alderman of
Mercia. Then, as the chronicler writes, &ldquo;all the Angle race
turned to him (Alfred) that were not in bondage of the Danish
men.&rdquo; In 896 the Londoners came off victorious in their encounters
with the Danes. The king obstructed the river so
that the enemy could not bring up their ships, and they therefore
abandoned them. The Londoners broke up some, and brought
the strongest and best to London. In 912 Æthelred, the alderman
of the Mercians, who had been placed in authority by Alfred, died,
and Edward the Elder took possession of London and Oxford,
&ldquo;and all the lands which thereto belonged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under Æthelstan we find the city increasing in importance
and general prosperity. There were then eight mints at work,
a fact which exhibits evidence of great activity and the need of
coin for the purposes of trade. The folk-moot met in the precincts
of St Paul&rsquo;s at the sound of the bell of the famous bell-tower,
which also rang out when the armed levy was required
to march under St Paul&rsquo;s banner. For some years after the
decisive battle of Brunanburh (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 937) the Danes ceased to
trouble the country. Fire, however, was almost as great an
enemy to London as the Dane. Fabyan when recording the
entire destruction of London by fire in the reign of Æthelred (981)
makes this remarkable statement&mdash;&ldquo;Ye shall understand that
this daye the cytie of London had more housynge and buyldinge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page958" id="page958"></a>958</span>
from Ludgate toward Westmynstre and lytel or none wher
the chief or hart of the citie is now, except (that) in dyvers places
were housyng, but they stod without order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the reign of Æthelred II., called the Unready (but more
correctly the Redeless), the Danes were more successful in their
operations against London, but the inhabitants resisted stoutly.
Snorre the Icelander tells us that the Danes fortified Southwark
with ditch and rampart, which the English assailed in vain.
In 982 London was burnt, and in 994 Olaf and Sweyn (the father
of Canute) came with ninety-four ships to besiege it. They tried
to set the city on fire, but the townsmen did them more harm
than they &ldquo;ever weened.&rdquo; The chronicler piously adds that
&ldquo;the holy Mother of God on that day manifested her mercy
to the townsmen, and delivered them from their foes.&rdquo; The
Danes went from the town and ravaged the neighbourhood, so
that in the end the king and his witan agreed to give sixteen
thousand pounds to be relieved of the presence of the enemy.
This was the origin of the Danegelt. In the year 1009 the Danes
frequently attacked London, but they had no success, and fared
ill in their attempts. The Londoners withstood Sweyn in 1013,
but in the end they submitted and gave him hostages. Three
years after this, Æthelred died in London, and such of the witan
as were there and the townsmen chose Edmund Ironside for
king, although the witan outside London had elected Canute.
Canute&rsquo;s ships were then at Greenwich on their way to London,
where they soon afterwards arrived. The Danes at once set
to work to dig a great ditch by Southwark, and then dragged their
ships through to the west side of the bridge. They were able after
this to keep the inhabitants from going either in or out of the
town. In spite of all this, after fighting obstinately both by land
and by water, the Danes had to raise the siege of London and
take the ships to the river Orwell. After a glorious reign of seven
months Edmund died in London, and Canute became master
of England. The tribute which the townsmen of London had
to pay was £10,500, about one-seventh of the amount which
was paid by all the rest of the English nation. This shows the
growing importance of the city. From this time there appears
to have been a permanent Danish settlement in London, probably
Aldwich, referred to below.</p>

<p>There is little more to be said of the history of Saxon London
than that Edward the Confessor held his Witanagemot there.
On his death the Witan which had attended his funeral elected
to succeed him Harold, the foremost man in England, and the
leader who had attempted to check the spread of the Norman
influence fostered by the Confessor. After his defeat and death
on the hill on the Sussex Downs then called Senlac, the duke
of Normandy had the country at his mercy, but he recognized
the importance of London&rsquo;s position, and moved forward with
the greatest caution and tact.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the history of London during the
Norman period it is necessary to say something of the counties
more especially connected with London.</p>

<p>The walled city of London was a distinct political unit, although
it owed a certain allegiance to that one of the kingdoms around
it which was the most powerful for the time being.
This allegiance therefore frequently changed, but
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Home Counties.&rdquo;</span>
London retained its identity and individuality all
through. Essex seems seldom to have held an independent
position, for when London first appears as connected
with the East Saxons the real power was in the hands of the
king of Kent. According to Bede, Wini, being expelled from
his bishopric of Wessex in 635, took refuge with Wulfhere, king
of the Mercians, of whom he purchased the see of London.
Hence the Mercian king must then have been the overlord of
London. Not many years afterwards the king of Kent again
seems to have held some jurisdiction here. From the laws of the
Kentish kings Lhothhere and Eadric (673-685) we learn that the
Wic-reeve was an officer of the king of Kent, who exercised a
jurisdiction over the Kentish men trading with or at London,
or was appointed to watch over their interests.</p>

<p>The origin of the two counties in which London is chiefly
situated opens up an interesting question. It is necessary to
remember that London is older than these counties, whose
names, Middlesex and Surrey, indicate their relative positions
to the city and the surrounding county. We have neither
record of their settlement nor of the origin of their names.
Both must have been peopled from the river. The name Middle
Saxons plainly shows that Middlesex must have been settled
after the East and West Saxons had given their names to their
respective districts. The name Surrey clearly refers to the
southern position of the county.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to a Danish settlement, and
there seems some reason for placing it on the ground now
occupied by the parishes of St Clement Danes and
St Giles&rsquo;s. For many centuries this district between
<span class="sidenote">Aldwich.</span>
London and Westminster was a kind of &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s land&rdquo; having
certain archaic customs. Gomme in his <i>Governance of London</i>
(1907) gives an account of the connexion of this with the old
village of Aldwich, a name that survived in Wych Street, and
has been revived by the London County Council in Aldwych,
the crescent which leads to Kingsway.</p>

<p>3. <i>Norman</i> (1066-1154).&mdash;To return to the condition of things
after the great battle. The citizens of London were a divided
body, and Duke William knowing that he had many
friends in the city saw that a waiting game was the
<span class="sidenote">The Conquest.</span>
best for his cause in the end. The defeated chiefs
retired on the city, led by Ansgar the Staller, under whom as
sheriff the citizens of London had marched to fight for Harold
at Senlac. They elected Edgar Atheling, the grandson of Edmund
Ironside, as king, which the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> says &ldquo;was indeed
his natural right.&rdquo; On hearing of this action William marched
towards London, when the citizens sallied forth to meet him.
They were repulsed by the Norman horse, but with such loss
to the latter that the duke thought it imprudent to lay siege to
the city at that time, and he retired to Berkhampstead.<a name="fa5f" id="fa5f" href="#ft5f"><span class="sp">5</span></a> It is
reported that William sent a private message to Ansgar asking
for his support. The result was that Edgar and Earls Edwin
and Morkere and &ldquo;the best men of London&rdquo; repaired to Berkhampstead,
where they submitted themselves and swore fealty
to the Conqueror.</p>

<p>Thus ends the Saxon period, and the Norman period in London
begins with the submission of the citizens as distinct from the
action of the rest of the kingdom, which submission
resulted soon afterwards in the Conqueror&rsquo;s remarkable
<span class="sidenote">Changes in the City.</span>
charter to William the bishop and Gosfrith the portreeve,
supposed to be the elder Geoffrey de Mandeville.
A great change was at once made both in the appearance and
in the government of the city under Norman rule. One of the
earliest acts of the Conqueror was to undertake the erection of
a citadel which should overawe the citizens and give him the
command of the city. The Tower was situated at the eastern
limit of the city, and not far from the western extremity Castle
Baynard was built.</p>

<p>The position of the city grew in importance, but the citizens
suffered from severe laws and from serious restrictions upon
their liberties. In August 1077 occurred a most extensive
fire, such a one, says the <i>Chronicle</i>, as &ldquo;never was before
since London was founded.&rdquo; This constant burning of large
portions of the city is a marked feature of its early history, and
we must remember that, although stone buildings were rising
on all sides, these were churches, monasteries, and other public
edifices; the ordinary houses remained as before, small wooden
structures. The White Tower, the famous keep of the Tower of
London, was begun by Gundulph, bishop of Rochester, <i>c.</i> 1078.
In 1083 the old cathedral of St Paul&rsquo;s was begun on the site of
the church which Æthelbert is said to have founded in 610. But
four years afterwards the chronicler tells us &ldquo;the holy monastery
of St Paul, the episcopal see of London, was burnt, and many
other monasteries, and the greatest and fairest part of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page959" id="page959"></a>959</span>
city.&rdquo; In this same year (1087) william the Conqueror died.
In 1090 a tremendous hurricane passed over London, and blew
down six hundred houses and many churches. The Tower was
injured, and a portion of the roof of the church of St Mary-le-Bow,
Cheapside, was carried off and fell some distance away,
being forced into the ground as much as 20 ft., a proof of the
badness of the thoroughfares as well as of the force of the wind,
William Rufus inherited from his father a love for building,
and in the year 1097 he exacted large sums of money from his
subjects with the object of carrying on some of the undertakings
he had in hand. These were the walling round of the Tower
and the rebuilding of London Bridge, which had been almost
destroyed by a flood. In 1100 Rufus was slain, and Henry I.
was crowned in London. This king granted the citizens their
first real charter, but this was constantly violated, when
Stephen seized the crown on the death of Henry I., he tried
successfully to obtain the support of the people of London.
He published a charter confirming in general terms the one
granted by Henry, and commanding that the good laws of
Edward the Confessor should be observed. The citizens, however,
did not obtain their rights without paying for them, and in
1139 they paid Stephen one hundred marks of silver to enable
them to choose their own sheriffs. In this reign the all-powerfulness
of the Londoners is brought prominently forward. Stephen
became by the shifting fortune of war a prisoner, and the empress
Matilda might, if she had had the wisdom to favour the citizens,
have held the throne, which was hers by right of birth. She,
however, made them her enemies by delivering up the office
of justiciary of London and the sheriffwick to her partisan
Geoffrey, earl of Essex, and attempting to reduce the citizens
to the enslaved condition of the rest of the country. This made
her influential enemies, who soon afterwards replaced Stephen
upon the throne. The Norman era closes with the death of
Stephen in 1154.</p>

<p>One of the most striking changes in the appearance of Norman
London was caused by the rebuilding of old churches and the
building of new ones, and also by the foundation of
the great monastic establishments. The early history
<span class="sidenote">Early parishes.</span>
of the parishes of London is one of great difficulty and
complexity. Although some of the parishes must be of great
antiquity, we have little authentic information respecting them
before the Conquest. The dedications of many of the churches
indicate their great age, but the constant fires in London
destroyed these buildings. The original churches appear to have
been very small, as may be judged from their number. It is not
easy, however, to understand how it was that when the first
parishes were formed so small an area was attached to each.
The parish church of which we have the most authentic notice
before the Conquest is St Helen&rsquo;s, Bishopsgate. It was in
existence many years before the priory of the nuns of St Helen&rsquo;s
was founded. Bishop Stubbs in his Introduction to the Historical
Works of Ralph de Diceto writes: &ldquo;St Paul&rsquo;s stood at the
head of the religious life of London, and by its side, at some
considerable interval, however, St Martin&rsquo;s le Grand (1056),
St Bartholomew&rsquo;s, Smithfield (1123) and the great and ancient
foundation of Trinity, Aldgate&rdquo; (1108). The great Benedictine
<span class="sidenote">Religious foundations.</span>
monastery of Black Monks was situated away from
the city at Westminster, and it was the only monastic
house subject to the rule of St Benedict in the neighbourhood
of London, although the houses of nuns,
of which there were many dotted over the suburbs of London,
were governed by this rule. In course of time there was a widespread
desire in Europe for a stricter rule among the monks,
and reforms of the Benedictine rule were instituted at Cluni
(910), Chartreuse (about 1080) and Citeaux (1098). All these
reforms were represented in London.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Cluniac Order.</i>&mdash;This order was first brought to England by
William, earl of Warren (son-in-law of William the Conqueror), who
built the first house at Lewes in Sussex about 1077. The priory of
Bermondsey in Surrey was founded by Aylwin Child, citizen of
London about 1082.</p>

<p><i>Carthusians.</i>&mdash;When this order was brought to England in 1178 the
first house was founded at Witham in Somersetshire. In all there
were nine houses of the order in England. One of these was the
Charterhouse of London which was not founded until 1371 by Sir
Walter Manny, K.G.</p>

<p><i>Cistercians.</i>&mdash;It was usual to plant these monasteries in solitary
and uncultivated places, and no other house, even of their own
order, was allowed to build within a certain distance of the original
establishment. This makes it surprising to learn that there were two
separate houses of this order in the near neighbourhood of London.
A branch of the order came to England about 1128 and the first
house was founded at Waverley in Surrey. Very shortly after (about
1134) the abbey of Stratford Langthorne in Essex was founded by
William de Montfichet, who endowed it with all his lordship in West
Ham. It was not until two centuries afterwards that the second
Cistercian house in the immediate neighbourhood of London was
founded. This was the Abbey of St Mary Graces, East-Minster or
New Abbey without the walls of London, beyond Tower Hill, which
Edward III. instituted in 1350 after a severe scourge of plague (the
so-called Black Death).</p>

<p>The two great Military Orders&mdash;the Knights Hospitallers of St
John of Jerusalem and the Templars&mdash;followed the Augustinian rule
and were both settled in London. The Hospital or Priory of St John
was founded in 1100 by Jordan Briset and his wife Muriel, outside
the northern wall of London, and the original village of Clerkenwell
grew up around the buildings of the knights. A few years after this
the Brethren of the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem or Knights of
the Temple came into being at the Holy City, and they settled first
on the south side of Holborn near Southampton Row. They removed
to Fleet Street or the New Temple in 1184. On the suppression
of the order by command of the pope the house in Fleet Street
was given in 1313 by Edward II. to Aymer de Valence, earl of
Pembroke, at whose death in 1324 the property passed to the knights
of St John, who leased the new Temple to the lawyers, still the
occupants of the district.</p>

<p>The queen of Henry I. (Matilda or Maud) was one of the chief
founders of religious houses, and so great was the number of
monasteries built in this king&rsquo;s reign that it was said almost all the
labourers became bricklayers and carpenters and there was much
discontent in consequence.</p>
</div>

<p>4. <i>Plantagenet</i> (<i>1154-1485</i>).&mdash;Henry II. appears to have been
to a certain extent prejudiced against the citizens of London
on account of their attitude towards his mother, and
he treated them with some severity. In 1176 the
<span class="sidenote">Fitzstephen&rsquo;s description of London.</span>
rebuilding of London Bridge with stone was begun by
Peter of Colechurch. This was the bridge which was
pulled down early in the 19th century. It consisted of
twenty stone arches and a drawbridge. There was a gatehouse
at each end and a chapel or crypt in the centre, dedicated to St
Thomas of Canterbury, in which Peter of Colechurch was buried
in 1205. The large amount of building at this time proves that
the citizens were wealthy. Fitzstephen, the monk of Canterbury,
has left us the first picture of London. He speaks of its wealth,
commerce, grandeur and magnificence&mdash;of the mildness of the
climate, the beauty of the gardens, the sweet, clear and salubrious
springs, the flowing streams, and the pleasant clack of the
watermills. Even the vast forest of Middlesex, with its densely
wooded thickets, its coverts of game, stags, fallow deer, boars
and wild bulls is pressed into the description to give a contrast
which shall enhance the beauty of the city itself. Fitzstephen
tells how, when the great marsh that washed the walls of the
city on the north (Moorfields) was frozen over, the young men
went out to slide and skate and sport on the ice. Skates made
of bones have been dug up in this district. This sport was
allowed to fall into disuse, and was not again prevalent until it
was introduced from Holland after the Restoration.</p>

<p>In spite of Fitzstephen&rsquo;s glowing description we must remember
that the houses of London were wholly built of wood and thatched
with straw or reeds. These houses were specially liable to be
destroyed by fire, and in order to save the city from this imminent
danger the famous Assize of Building known as &ldquo;Fitz-Ailwyne&rsquo;s
Assize&rdquo; was drawn up in 1189. In this document the following
statement was made: &ldquo;Many citizens, to avoid such danger,
built according to their means, on their ground, a stone house
covered and protected by thick tiles against the fury of fire,
whereby it often happened that when a fire arose in the city
and burnt many edifices and had reached such a house, not being
able to injure it, it then became extinguished, so that many
neighbours&rsquo; houses were wholly saved from fire by that house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Various privileges were conceded to those who built in stone,
but no provision was made as to the material to be used in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page960" id="page960"></a>960</span>
roofing tenements. This Assize, which has been described as the
earliest English Building Act, is of great value from an historical
point of view, but unfortunately it had little practical effect,
and in 1212 what was called &ldquo;Fitz-Ailwyne&rsquo;s Second Assize,&rdquo;
with certain compulsory regulations, was enacted. Thenceforth
everyone who built a house was strictly charged not to cover it
with reeds, rushes, stubble or straw, but only with tiles, shingle
boards or lead. In future, in order to stop a fire, houses could
be pulled down in case of need with an alderman&rsquo;s hook and cord.
For the speedy removal of burning houses each ward was to
provide a strong iron hook, with a wooden handle, two chains
and two strong cords, which were to be left in the charge of the
bedel of the ward, who was also provided with a good horn,
&ldquo;loudly sounding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard I. was a popular king, but his fighting in the Holy
Land cost his subjects much. London had to pay heavily
towards his ransom; and, when the king made his triumphal
entry into London after his release from imprisonment, a German
nobleman is said to have remarked that had the emperor known
of the wealth of England he would have insisted on a larger sum.
The Londoners were the more glad to welcome Richard back in
that the head of the regency, Longchamp, bishop of Ely, was
very unpopular from the encroachments he made upon the city
with his works at the Tower.</p>

<p>The first charter by which the city claims the jurisdiction and
conservancy of the river Thames was granted by Richard I.
John granted several charters to the city, and it was expressly
stipulated in Magna Charta that the city of London should have
all its ancient privileges and free customs. The citizens opposed
the king during the wars of the barons. In the year 1215 the
barons having received intelligence secretly that they might
enter London with ease through Aldgate, which was then in a
very ruinous state, removed their camp from Bedford to Ware,
and shortly after marched into the city in the night-time. Having
succeeded in their object, they determined that so important a
gate should no longer remain in a defenceless condition. They
therefore spoiled the religious houses and robbed the monastery
coffers in order to have means wherewith to rebuild it. Much of
the material was obtained from the destroyed houses of the
unfortunate Jews, but the stone for the bulwarks was obtained
from Caen, and the small bricks or tiles from Flanders.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the great change in the
aspect of London and its surroundings made during the Norman
period by the establishment of a large number of monasteries.
A still more important change in the configuration of the interior
of London was made in the 13th century, when the various
orders of the friars established themselves there. The Benedictine
monks preferred secluded sites; the Augustinians did
not cultivate seclusion so strictly; but the friars chose the
interior of towns by preference. At the beginning of the 13th
century the remarkable evangelical revival, instituted almost
simultaneously by St Dominic and St Francis, swept over
Europe.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The four chief orders of Mendicant friars were magnificently
housed in London:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Blackfriars.</i>&mdash;The Black, Preaching or Dominican Friars came to
England in 1221 and their first house was at Oxford. Shortly after
this they came London and settled in Holborn near
<span class="sidenote">Mendicant friars.</span>
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, where they remained for more than fifty
years. In 1276 they removed to the neighbourhood of
Baynard Castle, and their house gave a name to a London district
which it still retains.</p>

<p><i>Greyfriars.</i>&mdash;The Greyfriars, Minorites or Franciscans, first settled
in Cornhill, and in 1224 John Ewin made over to them an estate
situated in the ward of Farringdon Within and in the parish of St
Nicholas in the Shambles, where their friary was built. Christ
Church, Newgate Street, occupies the site of the choir of the great
church of the Greyfriars.</p>

<p><i>Austin Friars.</i>&mdash;The house of the Austin Friars or Friars Eremites
was founded in Broad Street ward in 1253.</p>

<p><i>White Friars.</i>&mdash;The Friars of the Blessed Virgin of Mount Carmel
or Carmelites or Whitefriars came to London in 1241, and made their
home on land between Fleet Street and the Thames given by
Edward I.</p>

<p>Besides the four chief orders of friars there were the Crutched
Friars in the parish of St Olave, Hart Street (about 1298), and the
Friars of the Sac first outside Aldersgate (about 1257) and afterwards
in the Old Jewry.</p>
</div>

<p>The names of places in London form valuable records of the
habitations of different classes of the population. The monasteries
and friaries are kept in memory by their names in various
parts of London. In the same way the residences of the Jews
have been marked. When Edward I. expelled the Jews from
England in 1290 the district in which they had lived since
William the Conqueror&rsquo;s day came to be called the Old Jewry.
On their return after many centuries of exile most of them
settled in the neighbourhood of Aldgate and Aldersgate. There
is a reminder of them in the names of Jewry Street near the
former and of Jewin Street near the latter place. Jewin Street
was built on the site of the burying-place of the Jews before the
expulsion.</p>

<p>In the middle ages there was a constant succession of pageants,
processions and tournaments. The royal processions arranged
in connexion with coronations were of great antiquity,
but one of the earliest to be described is that of Henry
<span class="sidenote">Pageants.</span>
III. in 1236, which was chronicled by Matthew Paris. After
the marriage at Canterbury of the king with Eleanor of Provence
the royal personages came to London, and were met by the
mayor, aldermen and principal citizens to the number of 360,
sumptuously apparelled in silken robes embroidered, riding upon
stately horses. After the death of Henry III. (1272) the country
had to wait for their new king, who was then in the Holy Land.
Edward I. came to London on the 2nd of August 1274, when he
was received with the wildest expressions of joy. The streets
were hung with rich cloths of silk arras and tapestry; the
aldermen and principal men of the city threw out of their
windows handsful of gold and silver, to signify their gladness
at the king&rsquo;s return; and the conduits ran with wine, both
white and red.</p>

<p>Dr Jessopp gives a vivid picture of what occurred when
King Edward III. entered London in triumph on the 14th of
October 1347. He was the foremost man in Europe, and England
had reached a height of power and glory such as she had never
attained before. Ten years after this, one of the most famous
scenes in the streets of London occurred, when Edward the Black
Prince brought the French King John and other prisoners after
the battle of Poitiers to England. This was a scene unequalled
until Henry V. returned from the glorious field of Agincourt in
1415. The mayor and aldermen apparelled in orient-grained
scarlet, and four hundred commoners in murrey, well mounted,
with rich collars and chains, met the king at Blackheath. At
the entrance to London Bridge the towers were adorned with
banners of the royal arms, and in the front of them was inscribed
<i>Civitas Regis Justicie</i>.</p>

<p>During the troubles of the 15th century the authorities had
seen the necessity of paying more attention to the security of the
gates and walls of the city, and when Thomas Nevill, son of
William, Lord Fauconberg, made his attack upon London in
1471 he experienced a spirited resistance. He first attempted to
land from his ships in the city, but the Thames side from
Baynard&rsquo;s Castle to the Tower was so well fortified that he had to
seek a quieter and less prepared position. He then set upon the
several gates in succession, and was repulsed at all. On the 11th
of May he made a desperate attack upon Aldgate, followed by
500 men. He won the bulwarks and some of his followers entered
into the city, but the portcullis being let down these were cut off
from their own party and were slain by the enemy. The portcullis
was drawn up, and the besieged issued forth against the
rebels, who were soon forced to flee.</p>

<p>When Richard, duke of Gloucester, laid his plans for seizing
the crown, he obtained the countenance of the lord mayor, Sir
Edmund Shaw, whose brother Dr Shaw praised Richard at Paul&rsquo;s
Cross. Crosby Hall, in Bishopsgate Street, then lately built, was
made the lodging of the Protector. There he acted the accessible
prince in the eyes of the people, for the last of the Plantagenets
was another of the usurpers who found favour in the eyes of the
men of London. His day, however, was short, and with the
battle of Bosworth ends Plantagenet London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page961" id="page961"></a>961</span></p>

<p>5. <i>Tudor</i> (<i>1485-1603</i>).&mdash;It was during this period that the
first maps of London were drawn. No representation of the
city earlier than the middle of the 16th century has
been discovered, although it seems more than probable
<span class="sidenote">First maps of London.</span>
that some plans must have been produced at an
earlier period.<a name="fa6f" id="fa6f" href="#ft6f"><span class="sp">6</span></a> The earliest known view is the drawing of
Van den Wyngaerde in the Bodleian Library (dated 1550).
Braun and Hogenberg&rsquo;s map was published in 1572-1573, and
the so-called Agas&rsquo;s map was probably produced soon afterwards,
and was doubtless influenced by the publication of Braun and
Hogenberg&rsquo;s excellent engraving; Norden&rsquo;s maps of London
and Westminster are dated 1593. Some of these maps were
pasted upon walls, and must have been largely destroyed by
ordinary wear and tear. It is curious that the only two existing
copies of Agas&rsquo;s map<a name="fa7f" id="fa7f" href="#ft7f"><span class="sp">7</span></a> were published in the reign of James I.,
although apparently they had not been altered from the earlier
editions of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign which have been lost. By the
help of these maps we are able to obtain a clear notion of the
extent and chief characteristics of Tudor London. Henry VII.
did little to connect his name with the history of London,
although the erection of the exquisite specimen of florid Gothic
at Westminster Abbey has carried his memory down in its
popular name of Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel. Soon after this king obtained
the throne he borrowed the sum of 3000 marks from the
city, and moreover founded the excellent precedent of repaying
it at the appointed time. The citizens were so pleased at this
unexpected occurrence that they willingly lent the king £6000
in 1488, which he required for military preparations against
France. In 1497 London was threatened by the rebels favourable
to Perkin Warbeck, who encamped on Blackheath on
the 17th of June. At first there was a panic among the citizens,
but subsequently the city was placed in a proper state of defence,
and the king himself encamped in St George&rsquo;s Fields. On June
22 he entirely routed the rebels; and some time afterwards
Perkin Warbeck gave himself up, and was conducted in triumph
through London to the Tower.</p>

<p>As the chief feature of Norman London was the foundation
of monasteries, and that of Plantagenet London was the establishment
of friaries, so Tudor London was specially
characterized by the suppression of the whole of these
<span class="sidenote">Suppression of religious houses.</span>
religious houses, and also of the almost numberless
religious gilds and brotherhoods. When we remember
that more than half of the area of London was occupied by
these establishments, and that about a third of the inhabitants
were monks, nuns and friars, it is easy to imagine how great
must have been the disorganization caused by this root and
branch reform. One of the earliest of the religious houses to be
suppressed was the hospital of St Thomas of Acon (or Acre)
on the north side of Cheapside, the site of which is now
occupied by Mercers&rsquo; Hall. The larger houses soon followed,
and the Black, the White and the Grey Friars, with the
Carthusians and many others, were all condemned in November
1538.</p>

<p>Love of show was so marked a characteristic of Henry VIII.
that we are not surprised to find him encouraging the citizens
in the same expensive taste. On the occasion of his marriage
with Catherine of Aragon the city was gorgeously ornamented
with rich silks and tapestry, and Goldsmiths&rsquo; Row (Cheapside)
and part of Cornhill were hung with golden brocades. When
on the eve of St John&rsquo;s Day, 1510, the king in the habit of a
yeoman of his own guard saw the famous march of the city
watch, he was so delighted that on the following St Peter&rsquo;s Eve
he again attended in Cheapside to see the march, but this time
he was accompanied by the queen and the principal nobility.
The cost of these two marches in the year was very considerable,
and, having been suspended in 1528 on account of the prevalence
of the sweating sickness, they were soon afterwards forbidden
by the king, and discontinued during the remainder of
his reign. Sir John Gresham, mayor in 1548, revived the march
of the city watch, which was made more splendid by the addition
of three hundred light horsemen raised by the citizens for the
king&rsquo;s service.</p>

<p>The best mode of utilizing the buildings of the suppressed
religious houses was a difficult question left unsolved by Henry
VIII. That king, shortly before his death, refounded Rahere&rsquo;s
St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, &ldquo;for the continual relief and help
of an hundred sore and diseased,&rdquo; but most of the large buildings
were left unoccupied to be filled by his successor. The first
parliament of Edward&rsquo;s reign gave all the lands and possessions
of colleges, chantries, &amp;c., to the king, when the different companies
of London redeemed those which they had held for the
payment of priests&rsquo; wages, obits and lights at the price of £20,000,
and applied the rents arising from them to charitable purposes.
In 1550 the citizens purchased the manor of Southwark, and
with it they became possessed of the monastery of St Thomas,
which was enlarged and prepared for the reception of &ldquo;poor,
sick and helpless objects.&rdquo; Thus was refounded St Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospital, which was moved to Lambeth in 1870-1871. Shortly
before his death Edward founded Christ&rsquo;s Hospital in the Grey
Friars, and gave the old palace of Bridewell to the city &ldquo;for
the lodging of poor wayfaring people, the correction of vagabonds
and disorderly persons, and for finding them work.&rdquo; On the
death of Edward VI. Lady Jane Grey was received at the Tower
as queen, she having gone there by water from Durham House
in the Strand. The citizens, however, soon found out their
mistake, and the lord mayor, aldermen and recorder proclaimed
Queen Mary at Cheapside. London was then gay with pageants,
but when the queen made known her intention of marrying
Philip of Spain the discontent of the country found vent in the
rising of Sir Thomas Wyat, and the city had to prepare itself
against attack. Wyat took possession of Southwark, and expected
to have been admitted into London; but finding the
gates shut against him and the drawbridge cut down he marched
to Kingston, the bridge at which place had been destroyed.
This he restored, and then proceeded towards London. In
consequence of the breakdown of some of his guns he imprudently
halted at Turnham Green. Had he not done so it
is probable that he might have obtained possession of the city.
He planted his ordnance on Hay Hill, and then marched by
St James&rsquo;s Palace to Charing Cross. Here he was attacked
by Sir John Gage with a thousand men, but he repulsed them
and reached Ludgate without further opposition. He was
disappointed at the resistance which was made, and after musing
a while &ldquo;upon a stall over against the Bell Savadge Gate&rdquo;
he turned back. His retreat was cut off, and he surrendered
to Sir Maurice Berkeley, we have somewhat fully described
this historical incident here because it has an important bearing
on the history of London, and shows also the small importance
of the districts outside the walls at that period.</p>

<p>We now come to consider the appearance of London during
the reign of the last of the Tudors. At no other period were so
many great men associated with its history; the
latter years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign are specially interesting
<span class="sidenote">Tudor London.</span>
to us because it was then that Shakespeare lived
in London, and introduced its streets and people into his plays.
In those days the frequent visitation of plagues made men
fear the gathering together of multitudes. This dread of pestilence,
united with a puritanic hatred of plays, made the citizens
do all they could to discountenance theatrical entertainments.
The queen acknowledged the validity of the first reason, but she
repudiated the religious objection provided ordinary care was
taken to allow &ldquo;such plays only as were fitted to yield honest
recreation and no example of evil.&rdquo; On April 11, 1582, the lords
of the council wrote to the lord mayor to the effect that, as &ldquo;her
Majesty sometimes took delight in those pastimes, it had been
thought not unfit, having regard to the season of the year and
the clearance of the city from infection, to allow of certain
companies of players in London, partly that they might thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page962" id="page962"></a>962</span>
attain more dexterity and perfection the better to content her
Majesty&rdquo; (Analytical Index to the <i>Remembrancia</i>). When
theatres were established the lord mayor took care that they
should not be built within the city. The &ldquo;Theatre&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Curtain&rdquo; were situated at Shoreditch; the &ldquo;Globe,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; on the Bankside;
and the Blackfriars theatre, although within the walls, was
without the city jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In 1561 St Paul&rsquo;s steeple and roof were destroyed by lightning,
and the spire was never replaced. This circumstance allows
us to test the date of certain views; thus Wyngaerde&rsquo;s map
has the spire, but Agas&rsquo;s map is without it. In 1566 the first
stone was laid of the &ldquo;Burse,&rdquo; which owed its origin to Sir
Thomas Gresham. In 1571 Queen Elizabeth changed its name
to the Royal Exchange. The Strand was filled with noble
mansions washed by the waters of the Thames, but the street,
if street it could be called, was little used by pedestrians. Londoners
frequented the river, which was their great highway.
The banks were crowded with stairs for boats, and the watermen
of that day answered to the chairmen of a later date and the
cabmen of to-day. The Bankside was of old a favourite place
for entertainments, but two only&mdash;the bull-baiting and the
bear-baiting&mdash;were in existence when Agas&rsquo;s map was first
planned. On Norden&rsquo;s map,<a name="fa8f" id="fa8f" href="#ft8f"><span class="sp">8</span></a> however, we find the gardens of
Paris Garden, the bearhouse and the playhouse.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The settled character of the later years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign appears
to have caused a considerable change in the habits of the people.
Many of the chief citizens followed the example of the courtiers, and
built for themselves country residences in Middlesex, Essex and
Surrey; thus we learn from Norden that Alderman Roe lived at
Muswell Hill, and we know that Sir Thomas Gresham built a fine
house and planned a beautiful park at Osterley. The maps show us
much that remains somewhat the same as it was, but also much that
has greatly altered. St Giles&rsquo;s was literally a village in the fields;
Piccadilly was &ldquo;the waye to Redinge,&rdquo; Oxford Street &ldquo;the way to
Uxbridge,&rdquo; Covent Garden an open field or garden, and Leicester
Fields lammas land. Moorfields was drained and laid out in walks in
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. At Spitalfields crowds used to congregate on
Easter Monday and Tuesday to hear the Spital sermons preached
from the pulpit cross. The ground was originally a Roman Cemetery,
and about the year 1576 bricks were largely made from the clayey
earth, the recollection of which is kept alive in the name of Brick
Lane. Citizens went to Holborn and Bloomsbury for change of air,
and houses were there prepared for the reception of children, invalids
and convalescents. In the north were sprinkled the outlying villages
of Islington, Hoxton and Clerkenwell.</p>
</div>

<p>6. <i>Stuart</i> (<i>1603-1714</i>).&mdash;The Stuart period, from the accession
of James I. to the death of Queen Anne, extends over little more
than a century, and yet greater changes occurred during those
years than at any previous period. The early years of Stuart
London may be said to be closely linked with the last years of
Elizabethan London, for the greatest men, such as Raleigh,
Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, lived on into James&rsquo;s reign.
Much of the life of the time was then in the City, but the last
years of Stuart London take us to the 18th century, when social
life had permanently shifted to the west end. In the middle
of the period occurred the civil wars, and then the fire which
changed the whole aspect of London. When James came to
the throne the term suburbs had a bad name, as all those disreputable
persons who could find no shelter in the city itself
settled in these outlying districts. Stubbs denounced suburban
gardens and garden houses in his <i>Anatomy of Abuses</i>, and another
writer observed &ldquo;how happy were cities if they had no suburbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The preparations for the coronation of King James were
interrupted by a severe visitation of the plague, which killed
off as many as 30,578 persons, and it was not till March 15, 1604,
that the king, the queen and Prince Henry passed triumphantly
from the Tower to Westminster. The lord mayor&rsquo;s shows,
which had been discontinued for some years, were revived by
order of the king in 1609. The dissolved monastery of the
Charterhouse, which had been bought and sold by the courtiers
several times, was obtained from Thomas, earl of Suffolk, by
Thomas Sutton for £13,000. The new hospital chapel and
schoolhouse were begun in 1611, and in the same year Sutton
died.</p>

<p>With the death of James I. in 1625 the older history of London
may be said to have closed. During the reign of his successor
the great change in the relative positions of London
within and without the walls had set in. Before
<span class="sidenote">Social life.</span>
going on to consider the chief incidents of this change it will
be well to refer to some features of the social life of James&rsquo;s
reign. Ben Jonson places one of the scenes of <i>Every Man in his
Humour</i> in Moorfields, which at the time he wrote the play
had, as stated above, lately been drained and laid out in walks.
Beggars frequented the place, and travellers from the village
of Hoxton, who crossed it in order to get into London, did so
with as much expedition as possible. Adjoining Moorfields
were Finsbury Fields, a favourite practising ground for the
archers. Mile End, a common on the Great Eastern Road, was
long famous as a rendezvous for the troops. These places are
frequently referred to by the old dramatists; Justice Shallow
boasts of his doings at Mile End Green when he was Dagonet
in Arthur&rsquo;s Show. Fleet Street was the show-place of London,
in which were exhibited a constant succession of puppets,
naked Indians and strange fishes. The great meeting-place of
Londoners in the day-time was the nave of old St Paul&rsquo;s. Crowds
of merchants with their hats on transacted business in the aisles,
and used the font as a counter upon which to make their payments;
lawyers received clients at their several pillars; and masterless
serving-men waited to be engaged upon their own particular
bench. Besides those who came on business there were gallants
dressed in fashionable finery, so that it was worth the tailor&rsquo;s
while to stand behind a pillar and fill his table-books with notes.
The middle or Mediterranean aisle was the Paul&rsquo;s walk, also
called the Duke&rsquo;s Gallery from the erroneous supposition that
the tomb of Sir Guy Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, was that of
the &ldquo;good&rdquo; Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. After the Restoration
a fence was erected on the inside of the great north door
to hinder a concourse of rude people, and when the cathedral
was being rebuilt Sir Christopher Wren made a strict order
against any profanation of the sacred building. St Paul&rsquo;s
churchyard was from the earliest days of printing until the end
of the 18th century the headquarters of the book trade, when
it shifted to Paternoster Row. Another of the favourite haunts
of the people was the garden of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, where the choicest
society was to be met. There, under the shadow of the elm trees
which Bacon had planted, Pepys and his wife constantly walked.
Mrs Pepys went on one occasion specially to observe the fashions
of the ladies because she was then &ldquo;making some clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In those days of public conviviality, and for many years
afterwards, the taverns of London held a very important place.
The Boar&rsquo;s Head in Great Eastcheap was an inn of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s own day, and the characters he introduces
<span class="sidenote">Taverns.</span>
into his plays are really his own contemporaries. The &ldquo;Mermaid&rdquo;
is sometimes described as in Bread Street, and at other times in
Friday Street and also in Cheapside. We are thus able to fix
its exact position; for a little to the west of Bow church is
Bread Street, then came a block of houses, and the next thoroughfare
was Friday Street. It was in this block that the &ldquo;Mermaid&rdquo;
was situated, and there appear to have been entrances from
each street. What makes this fact still more certain is the
circumstance that a haberdasher in Cheapside living &ldquo;&rsquo;twixt
Wood Street and Milk Street,&rdquo; two streets on the north side
opposite Bread and Friday Streets, described himself as &ldquo;over
against the Mermaid tavern in Cheapside.&rdquo; The Windmill
tavern occupies a prominent position in the action of <i>Every
Man in his Humour</i>.<a name="fa9f" id="fa9f" href="#ft9f"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The Windmill stood at the corner of the
Old Jewry towards Lothbury, and the Mitre close by the Mermaid
in Bread Street. The Mitre in Fleet Street, so intimately
associated with Dr Johnson, also existed at this time. It is
mentioned in a comedy entitled <i>Ram Alley</i> (1611) and Lilly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page963" id="page963"></a>963</span>
astrologer frequented it in 1640. At the Mermaid Ben Jonson
had such companions as Shakespeare, Raleigh, Beaumont,
Fletcher, Carew, Donne, Cotton and Selden, but at the Devil
in Fleet Street, where he started the Apollo Club, he was omnipotent.
Herrick, in his well-known <i>Ode to Ben</i>, mentions
several of the inns of the day.</p>

<p>Under James I. the theatre, which established itself so firmly
in the latter years of Elizabeth, had still further increased its
influence, and to the entertainments given at the
many playhouses may be added the masques so
<span class="sidenote">Theatres.</span>
expensively produced at court and by the lawyers at the inns
of court. In 1613 <i>The Masque of Flowers</i> was presented by
the members of Gray&rsquo;s Inn in the Old Banqueting House in
honour of the marriage of the infamous Carr, earl of Somerset,
and the equally infamous Lady Frances, daughter of the earl
of Suffolk. The entertainment was prepared by Sir Francis
Bacon at a cost of about £2000.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of Charles I. that the first great exodus
of the wealthy and fashionable was made to the West End. The
great square or piazza of Covent Garden was formed
from the designs of Inigo Jones about 1632. The
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;West End.&rdquo;</span>
neighbouring streets were built shortly afterwards,
and the names of Henrietta, Charles, James, King and
York Streets were given after members of the royal family.
Great Queen Street, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, was built about 1629,
and named in honour of Henrietta Maria. Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields
had been planned some years before. With the Restoration the
separation of fashionable from city life became complete.</p>

<p>When the Civil War broke out London took the side of the
parliament, and an extensive system of fortification was at once
projected to protect the town against the threatened attack
of the royal army. A strong earthen rampart, flanked with
bastions and redoubts, surrounded the City, its liberties, Westminster
and Southwark, making an immense enclosure.</p>

<p>London had been ravaged by plague on many former occasions,
but the pestilence that began in December 1664 lives in history
as &ldquo;the Plague of London.&rdquo; On the 7th of June 1665
Samuel Pepys for the first time saw two or three
<span class="sidenote">The Plague.</span>
houses marked with the red cross and the words
&ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon us,&rdquo; on the doors. The deaths daily
increased, and business was stopped. Grass grew in the area
of the Royal Exchange, at Whitehall, and in the principal streets
of the city. On the 4th of September 1665 Pepys writes an
interesting letter to Lady Carteret from Woolwich: &ldquo;I have
stayed in the city till above 7400 died in one week, and of them
about 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day or night but
tolling of bells.&rdquo; The plague was scarcely stayed before the
whole city was in flames, a calamity of the first magnitude,
but one which in the end caused much good, as the seeds of
disease were destroyed, and London has never since been visited
by such an epidemic. On the 2nd of September 1666 the
fire broke out at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning at a house in
<span class="sidenote">The Great Fire.</span>
Pudding Lane. A violent east wind fomented the
flames, which raged during the whole of Monday and
great part of Tuesday. On Tuesday night the wind
fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On
Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day
the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were
at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally
mastered. Many interesting details of the fire are given in Pepys&rsquo;s
<i>Diary</i>. The river swarmed with vessels filled with persons
carrying away such of their goods as they were able to save.
Some fled to the hills of Hampstead and Highgate, but Moorfields
was the chief resort of the houseless Londoner. Soon paved
streets and two-storey houses were seen in that swampy place.
The people bore their troubles heroically, and Henry Oldenburg,
writing to the Hon. Robert Boyle on September 10, says: &ldquo;The
citizens, instead of complaining, discoursed almost of nothing but
of a survey for rebuilding the city with bricks and large streets.&rdquo;
Within a few days of the fire three several plans were presented
to the king for the rebuilding of the city, by Christopher Wren,
John Evelyn and Robert Hooke. Wren proposed to build
main thoroughfares north and south, and east and west, to
insulate all the churches in conspicuous positions, to form the
most public places into large piazzas, to unite the halls of the

<span class="sidenote">Rebuilding: Wren&rsquo;s scheme.</span>
from Blackfriars to the Tower. His streets were to be
of three magnitudes&mdash;90 ft., 60 ft. and 30 ft. wide
respectively. Evelyn&rsquo;s plan differed from Wren&rsquo;s
chiefly in proposing a street from the church of St
Dunstan&rsquo;s in the East to the cathedral, and in having no quay or
terrace along the river. In spite of the best advice, however,
the jealousies of the citizens prevented any systematic design
from being carried out, and in consequence the old lines were in
almost every case retained. But though the plans of Wren and
Hooke were not adopted, it was to these two fellows of the Royal
Society that the labour of rebuilding London was committed.
Wren&rsquo;s great work was the erection of the cathedral of St Paul&rsquo;s,
and the many churches ranged round it as satellites. Hooke&rsquo;s
task was the humbler one of arranging as city surveyor for
the building of the houses. He laid out the ground of the several
proprietors in the rebuilding of the city, and had no rest early or
late from persons soliciting him to set out their ground for them
at once. The first great impetus of change in the configuration
of London was given by the great fire, and Evelyn records and
regrets that the town in his time had grown almost as large again
as it was within his own memory. Although for several centuries
attempts had been made in favour of building houses with
brick or stone, yet the carpenters continued to be the chief house-builders.
As late as the year 1650 the Carpenters&rsquo; Company
drew up a memorial in which they &ldquo;gave their reasons that
tymber buildings were more commodious for this citie than
brick buildings were.&rdquo; The Act of Parliament &ldquo;for rebuilding
the city of London&rdquo; passed after the great fire, gave the <i>coup de
grâce</i> to the carpenters as house-builders. After setting forth
that &ldquo;building with brick was not only more comely and durable,
but also more safe against future perils of fire,&rdquo; it was enacted
&ldquo;that all the outsides of all buildings in and about the city
should be made of brick or stone, except doorcases and window-frames,
and other parts of the first story to the front between the
piers,&rdquo; for which substantial oaken timber might be used &ldquo;for
conveniency of shops.&rdquo; In the winter of 1683-1684 a fair was
held for some time upon the Thames. The frost, which began
about seven weeks before Christmas and continued for six weeks
after, was the greatest on record; the ice was 11 in. thick.</p>

<p>The revocation of the edict of Nantes in October 1685, and the
consequent migration of a large number of industrious French
Protestants, caused a considerable growth in the east end of
London. The silk manufactories at Spitalfields were then
established.</p>

<p>During the short reign of James II. the fortunes of the city were
at their lowest, and nowhere was the arrival of the prince of
Orange more welcomed.</p>

<p>William III. cared little for London, the smoke of which gave
him asthma, and when a great part of Whitehall was burnt in
1691 he purchased Nottingham House and made it into Kensington
Palace. Kensington was then an insignificant village,
but the arrival of the court soon caused it to grow in importance.</p>

<p>Although the spiritual wants of the city were amply provided
for by the churches built by Wren, the large districts outside
the city and its liberties had been greatly neglected. The act
passed in the reign of Queen Anne for building fifty new churches
(1710) for a time supplied the wants of large districts.</p>

<p>7. <i>Eighteenth Century.</i>&mdash;London had hitherto grown up by
the side of the Thames. In the 18th century other parts of the
town were more largely built upon. The inhabitants used coaches
and chairs more than boats, and the banks of the river were
neglected. London could no longer be seen as a whole, and
became a mere collection of houses. In spite of this the 18th
century produced some of the most devoted of Londoners&mdash;men
who considered a day lived out of London as one lost out
of their lives. Of this class Dr Johnson and Hogarth are striking
examples. The exhibitions of vice and cruelty that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page964" id="page964"></a>964</span>
constantly to be seen in the capital have been reproduced by
Hogarth, and had they not been set down by so truthful an
observer it would have been almost impossible to believe that such
enormities could have been committed in the streets of a great
city. A few days after his accession George I. addressed the
representatives of the city in these words: &ldquo;I have lately been
made sensible of what consequence the city of London is, and
therefore shall be sure to take all their privileges and interests
into my particular protection.&rdquo; On the following lord mayor&rsquo;s
day the king witnessed the show in Cheapside and attended the
banquet at Guildhall. Queen Anne and the first three Georges
were all accommodated, on the occasions of their visits to the
city to see the show, at the same house opposite Bow church.
In the time of Queen Anne and George I. David Barclay (the
son of the famous apologist for the Quakers) was an apprentice
in the house, but he subsequently became master, and had the
honour of receiving George II. and George III. as his guests.
There was a large balcony extending along the front of the house
which was fitted with a canopy and hangings of crimson damask
silk. The building, then numbered 108 Cheapside, was pulled
down in 1861.</p>

<p>Early in the 18th century there was a considerable extension
of building operations in the West End. Still, however, the
north of London remained unbuilt upon. In 1756
and for some years subsequently the land behind
<span class="sidenote">Extension in the 18th century.</span>
Montague House (now the British Museum) was
occupied as a farm, and when in that year a proposal
was made to plan out a new road the tenant and the duke of
Bedford strongly opposed it. In 1772 all beyond Portland
Chapel in Great Portland Street was country. Bedford House
in Bloomsbury Square had its full view of Hampstead and Highgate
from the back, and Queen&rsquo;s Square was built open to the
north in order that the inhabitants might obtain the same
prospect.</p>

<p>In 1737 the Fleet ditch between Holborn Bridge and Fleet
Bridge was covered over, and Stocks Market was removed from
the site of the Mansion House to the present Farringdon Street,
and called Fleet market. On October 25, 1739, the first stone
of the Mansion House was laid. Previously the first magistrates
lived in several different houses. A frost almost as severe as
the memorable one of 1683-1684 occurred in the winter of 1739-1740,
and the Thames was again the scene of a busy fair. In
1758 the houses on London Bridge were cleared away, and in
1760-1762 several of the city gates were taken down and sold.
Moorgate is said to have fetched £166, Aldersgate £91, Aldgate
£177, Cripplegate £90, and Ludgate £148. The statue of Queen
Elizabeth which stood on the west side of Ludgate was purchased
by Alderman Gosling and set up against the east end of
St Dunstan&rsquo;s church in Fleet Street, where it still remains.</p>

<p>8. <i>Nineteenth Century.</i>&mdash;In 1806 London saw the public
funerals of three of England&rsquo;s greatest men. On the 8th February
the body of Nelson was borne with great pomp from the
Admiralty to St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, where it was interred in the
presence of the prince of Wales and the royal dukes. Pitt was
buried on the 22nd of February, and Fox on the 10th of October,
both in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The first exhibition of Winsor&rsquo;s system of lighting the streets
with gas took place on the king&rsquo;s birthday (June 4) 1807, and
was made in a row of lamps in front of the colonnade before
Carlton House. Finsbury Square was the first public place in
which gas lighting was actually adopted, and Grosvenor Square
the last. In the winter of 1813-1814 the Thames was again
frozen over. The frost began on the evening of December 27,
1813, with a thick fog. After it had lasted for a month, a thaw
of four days, from the 26th to the 29th of January, took place,
but this thaw was succeeded by a renewal of the frost, so severe
that the river soon became one immovable sheet of ice. There
was a street of tents called the City Road, which was daily
thronged with visitors. In 1838 the second Royal Exchange
was destroyed by fire; and on October 28, 1844, the Queen
opened the new Royal Exchange, built by Mr (afterwards
Sir William) Tite. The Great Exhibition of 1851 brought a
larger number of visitors to London than had ever been in it
before at one time. The great and continuous increase in the
buildings and the enlargement of London on all sides dates from
this period.</p>

<p>London within the walls has been almost entirely rebuilt,
although in the neighbourhood of the Tower there are still
many old houses which have only been refronted. From the
upper rooms of the houses may be seen a large number of old
tiled roofs.</p>

<p>Unlike many capitals of Europe which have shifted their
centres the city of London in spite of all changes and the
continued enlargement of the capital remains the centre and
headquarters of the business of the country. The Bank of
England, the Royal Exchange and the Mansion House are on
the site of Ancient London.</p>

<p>In 1863 on the occasion of the marriage of King Edward VII.
(when prince of Wales) the streets of London were illuminated
as they had never been before. Among other events which
made the streets gay and centred in processions to St Paul&rsquo;s
may be specially mentioned the Thanksgiving Day on the 27th
of February 1872 for the recovery of the prince of Wales after
his dangerous illness; and the rejoicings at the Jubilee of Queen
Victoria in 1887, and the Diamond Jubilee in 1897.</p>

<p>The first great emigration of the London merchants westward
was about the middle of the 18th century, but only those who
had already secured large fortunes ventured so far as Hatton
Garden. At the beginning of the 19th century it had become
common for the tradesmen of the city to live away from their
businesses, but it was only about the middle of the 19th century
that it became at all usual for those in the West End to do the
same.</p>

<p>During the first half of the 19th century the position of the
City Corporation had somewhat fallen in public esteem, and
some of the most influential men in the city were unconnected
with it, but a considerable change took place in the latter half
of the century. Violent attacks were made upon the Livery
Companies, but of late years, largely owing to the public spirit
of the companies in devoting large sums of money towards the
improvement of the several industries in connexion with which
they were founded, and the establishment of the City and Guilds
of London Technical Institute, a complete change has taken
place as to the public estimation in which they are held.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Growth and Population</span></p>

<p>Much has been written upon the population of medieval London,
but little certainty has resulted therefrom. We know the size of
London at different periods and are able to guess to some
extent as to the number of its inhabitants, but most of the
<span class="sidenote">Medieval Population.</span>
figures which have come down to us are mere guesses. The
results of the poll-tax have often been considered as trustworthy
substitutes for population returns, but Professor Oman has
shown that little trust can be placed in these results. As an instance he
states that the commissioners of the poll-tax reported that there were
only two-thirds as many contributaries in 1381 as in 1377. The
adult population of the realm had ostensibly fallen from 1,355,201
to 896,481. These figures were monstrous and incredible.<a name="fa10f" id="fa10f" href="#ft10f"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>The Bills of Mortality of the 16th and 17th centuries are of more
value, and they have been considered and revised by such able
statisticians as John Graunt and Sir William Petty. It was not,
however, before the 19th century that accurate figures were obtainable.
The circuit of the walls of London which were left by the
Romans was never afterwards enlarged, and the population did not
overflow into the suburbs to any extent until the Tudor period.
Population was practically stationary for centuries owing to pestilences
and the large proportion of deaths among infants. We have
no materials to judge of the number of inhabitants before the Norman
Conquest, but we can guess that there were many open spaces within
the walls that were afterwards filled up. It is scarcely worth while
to guess as to the numbers in Saxon London, but it is possible that in
the early period there were about 10,000 inhabitants, growing later
to about 20,000. During the latter part of the Saxon period the
numbers of the population of the country began to decay; this decay,
however, was arrested by the Norman Conquest. The population
increased during ten peaceful years of Henry III., and increased
slowly until the death of Edward II., and then it began to fall off,
and continued to decrease during the period of the Wars of the Roses
and of the Barons until the accession of the first Tudor monarch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page965" id="page965"></a>965</span>
The same causes that operated to bring about these changes in the
whole kingdom were of course also at work in the case of the City of
London.</p>

<p>One of the earliest statements as to the population of London
occurs in a letter of about the year 1199 written to Pope Innocent III.
by Peter of Blois, then archdeacon of London, and therefore a man of
some authority on the subject. He states that the City contained
120 parish churches and 40,000 inhabitants. These numbers have
been very generally accepted as fairly correct, and Dr Creighton<a name="fa11f" id="fa11f" href="#ft11f"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
comes to the conclusion after careful consideration that the population
of London from the reign of Richard I. to that of Henry VII. varied
within a limit of about forty to fifty thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>Dr Creighton points out that the number given by certain
chroniclers of the deaths from the early pestilences in London are
incredible; such for instance as the statement that forty
or fifty thousand bodies were buried in Charterhouse
<span class="sidenote">Plagues and Mortality.</span>
churchyard at the time of the Black Death in 1348-1349.
These numbers have been taken as a basis for calculation
of population, and one statistician reasoned that if 50,000 were buried
in one churchyard 100,000 should represent the whole mortality of
London. If this were allowed the population at this time must have
been at least 200,000, an impossible amount.</p>

<p>Although the mortality caused by the different plagues had a great
effect upon the population of the country at large the city soon
recovered the losses by reason of the numbers who came to London
from outside in hopes of obtaining work. Although there were
fluctuations in the numbers at different periods there is evidence to
show that on the average the amount of forty to fifty thousand fixed
by Dr Creighton for the years between 1189 and 1509 is fairly correct.
The medieval period closed with the accession of the Tudor dynasty,
and from that time the population of London continued to increase,
in spite of attempts by the government to prevent it. One of the
first periods of increase was after the dissolution of the religious
houses; another period of increase was after the Restoration.</p>

<p>A proclamation was issued in 1580 prohibiting the erection within
3 m. of the city gates of any new houses or tenements &ldquo;where no
former house hath been known to have been.&rdquo; In a subsequent
proclamation Queen Elizabeth commanded that only one family
should live in one house, that empty houses erected within seven
years were not to be let and that unfinished buildings on new
foundations were to be pulled down. In spite of these restrictions
London continued to grow. James I. and Charles I. were filled with
the same fear of the increasing growth of London. In 1630 a similar
proclamation to that of 1580 was published. During the greater
part of the 18th century there was a serious check to the increase of
population, but at the end of the century a considerable increase
occurred, and in the middle of the 19th century the enormous annual
increase became particularly marked. To return to the 16th century
when the Bills of Mortality came into existence.<a name="fa12f" id="fa12f" href="#ft12f"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Mention is
made of these bills as early as 1517, but the earliest series now
<span class="sidenote">Bills of Mortality.</span>
known dates from 1532. Dr Creighton had access to the
manuscript returns of burials and christenings for five
years from 1578 to 1582 preserved in the library at
Hatfield House. The history of the Bills of Mortality which in the
early years were intermittent in their publication is of much interest,
and Dr Creighton has stated it with great clearness. The Company
of Parish Clerks is named in an ordinance of 1581 (of which there is a
copy in the Record Office) as the body responsible for the bills, and
their duties were then said to be &ldquo;according to the Order in that
behalf heretofore provided.&rdquo; John Bell, clerk to the company, who
wrote an essay during the great plague of 1665, had no records in
his office of an earlier date than 1593, and he was not aware that his
company had been engaged in registering births and deaths before
that year. The fire of 1666 destroyed all the documents of the Parish
Clerks Company, and in its hall in Silver Street only printed tables
from about the year 1700 are to be found. There is a set of Annual
Bills from 1658 (with the exception of the years 1756 to 1764) in the
library of the British Museum.<a name="fa13f" id="fa13f" href="#ft13f"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p>These bills were not analysed and general results obtained from
them until 1662, when Captain John Graunt first published his
valuable <i>Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of
Mortality</i>. Sir William Petty followed with his important inquiries
upon the population (<i>Essay on Political Arithmetic</i>, 1683).</p>

<p>It is not worth while to refer to all the wild guesses that were made
by various writers, but Dr Creighton shows the absurdity of one of
these calculations made in 1554 by Soranzo, the Venetian ambassador
for the information of the doge and senators of Venice.
He estimates the population to have been 180,000 persons, which
Dr Creighton affirms to be nearly three times the number that we
obtain by a moderate calculation from the bills of mortality in 1532
and 1535.</p>

<p>Following
<span class="sidenote">Population in 16th and 17th centuries.</span>
on his calculations from 1509, when the
population may be supposed to have been about 50,000,
Dr Creighton carries on his numbers to the Restoration
in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" style="clear: both;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">1532-1535</td> <td class="tcc rb">&ensp;62,400</td> <td class="tcc">1605</td> <td class="tcc">224,275</td></tr>

</table>

<p class="noind">The numbers for 1661 are those arrived at by Graunt, and they are
just about half the population given authoritatively in the first
census 1801 (864,845). It therefore took 140 years to double the
numbers, while in 1841 the numbers of 1801 were more than doubled.</p>

<p>These numbers were arrived at with much care and may be considered
as fairly accurate although some other calculations conflict
with a few of the figures. The first attempt at a census was in August
1631 when the lord mayor returned the number of mouths in the city
of London and Liberties at 130,268, which is only about half the
number given above. This is accounted for by the larger area contained
in the bills of mortality compared with that containing only
the city and its liberties.<a name="fa14f" id="fa14f" href="#ft14f"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Howell&rsquo;s suggestion that the population
of London in 1631 was a million and a half need only be mentioned
as a specimen of the wildest of guesses.</p>

<p>Petty&rsquo;s numbers for 1682 are 670,000 and those of Gregory King
for 1696, 530,000. The latter are corroborated by those of 1700,
which are given as 550,000. Maitland gives the numbers
in 1737 as 725,903. with regard to the relative size of
<span class="sidenote">18th century.</span>
great cities Petty affirms that before the Restoration the
people of Paris were more in number than those of London and
Dublin, whereas in 1687 the people of London were more than those
of Paris and Rome or of Paris and Rouen.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give any further numbers for the population
of the 18th century, as that has been already stated to have been
almost stationary. This is proved by Gregory King&rsquo;s figures for
1696 (530,000) when compared with those of the first census for 1801
(864,035). A corroboration is also to be found in the report of the
first census for 1801, where a calculation is made of the probable
population of the years 1700 and 1750. These are given respectively
as 674,350 and 676,250. These figures include (1) the City of London
within and (2) without the walls, (3) the City and Liberties of Westminster,
(4) the outparishes within the bills of mortality and (5) the
parishes not within the bills of mortality. No. 5 is given as 9150 in
1700, and 22,350 in 1750. It is curious to find that already in the
18th century a considerable reduction in the numbers of the city of
London is supposed to have taken place, as is seen in the following
figures:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc bb">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcc bb">1700.</td> <td class="tcc bb">1750.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl">City of London within the walls</td> <td class="tcc">139,300</td> <td class="tcc">87,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">City of London without the walls</td> <td class="tcc">&ensp;69,000</td> <td class="tcc">57,300</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">As the increase in Westminster is not great (130,000 in 1700 and
152,000 in 1750) and there is little difference in the totals it will be
seen that the amount is chiefly made up by the increase in the parishes
without the bills of mortality. The extraordinary growth of London
did not come into existence until about the middle of the 19th
century (see § IV. above).</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Government</span></p>

<p>We know little of the government of London during the Saxon
period, and it is only incidentally that we learn how the Londoner
had become possessed of special privileges which he
continued to claim with success through many centuries.
<span class="sidenote">Saxon Period.</span>
One of the chief of these was the claim to a separate voice
in the election of the king. The citizens did not dispute the right of
election by the kingdom but they held that that election did not
necessarily include the choice of London.</p>

<p>An instance of this is seen in the election of Edmund Ironside,
although the Witan outside London had elected Canute. The
remarkable instance of this after the Conquest was the election of
Stephen, but William the Conqueror did not feel secure until he had
the sanction of the Londoners to his kingship, and his attitude towards
London when he hovered about the neighbourhood of the city for a
time shows that he was anxious to obtain this sanction freely rather
than by compulsion. His hopes and expectations were fulfilled when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page966" id="page966"></a>966</span>
the gates of London were opened to receive him, as already related.
Athelstan&rsquo;s acceptance of the London-made law for the whole
kingdom, as pointed out by Mr Gomme, is another instance of the
independence of the Londoner. When William the Conqueror
granted the first charter to London he addressed the bishop and the
portreeve&mdash;the bishop as the ecclesiastical governor and the portreeve
as the representative of the civil power.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;port&rdquo; in the title &ldquo;portreeve&rdquo; does not indicate the
Port of London as might naturally be supposed, for Stubbs has
pointed out that it is <i>porta</i> not <i>portus</i>, and &ldquo;although used for the city
generally, seems to refer to it specially in its character of a Mart or
City of Merchants.&rdquo; The Saxon title of reeve was continued during
the Norman period and the shire-reeve or sheriff has continued to
our own time. There were originally several distinct reeves, all apparently
officers appointed by the king. Some writers have supposed
that a succession of portreeves continued in London, but J. H. Round
holds that this title disappeared after the Conqueror&rsquo;s charter.
Henry I. granted to the city by charter the right of appointing its
own sheriffs; this was a great privilege, which, however, was recalled
in the reigns of Henry II. and Richard I., to be restored by John in
1199.</p>

<p>J. H. Round holds that the office of Justiciar was created by
Henry I.&rsquo;s charter, and as he was the chief authority in the city this
somewhat takes off from the value of the privilege of appointing
sheriffs.</p>

<p>In the 12th century there was a great municipal movement over
Europe. Londoners were well informed as to what was going on
abroad, and although the rulers were always willing to wait for an
opportunity of enlarging their liberties, they remained ready to take
advantage of such circumstances as might occur. Their great opportunity
occurred while Richard I. was engaged abroad as a crusader.</p>

<p>In 1889 a medal was struck to commemorate the 700th anniversary
of the mayoralty which according to popular tradition was founded
in 1189. With respect to this tradition Round writes (<i>Commune of
London</i>, p. 223): &ldquo;The assumption that the mayoralty of London
dates from the accession of Richard I. is an absolute perversion of
history,&rdquo; and he adds that &ldquo;there is record evidence which completely
confirms the remarkable words of Richard of Devizes, who
declares that on no terms whatever would King Richard or his
father have ever assented to the establishment of the <i>Communa</i> in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In October 1191 the conflict between John the king&rsquo;s brother and
Longchamp the king&rsquo;s representative became acute. The latter
bitterly offended the Londoners, who, finding that they
could turn the scales to either side, named the Commune
<span class="sidenote">The Commune.</span>
as the price of their support of John. A small party of the
citizens under Henry of Cornhill remained faithful to the chancellor
Longchamp, but at a meeting held at St Paul&rsquo;s on the 8th of October,
the barons welcomed the archbishop of Rouen as chief justiciar
(he having produced the king&rsquo;s sign manual appointing a new commission),
and they saluted John as regent. Stubbs, in his introduction
to the Chronicle of Roger de Hoveden, writes: &ldquo;This done,
oaths were largely taken: John, the Justiciar and the Barons swore
to maintain the <i>Communa</i> of London; the oath of fealty to Richard
was then sworn, John taking it first, then the two archbishops, the
bishops, the barons, and last the burghers with the express understanding
that should the king die without issue they would receive
John as his successor.&rdquo; Referring to this important event Mr Round
writes: &ldquo;The excited citizens, who had poured out overnight, with
lanterns and torches, to welcome John to the capital, streamed
together on the morning of the eventful 8th of October at the well-known
sound of the great bell swinging out from its campanile in
St Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard. There they heard John take the oath to the
&lsquo;Commune&rsquo; like a French king or lord; and then London for the
first time had a municipality of her own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little is known as to what the Commune then established really
was. Round&rsquo;s remarkable discovery among the manuscripts of the
British Museum of the Oath of the Commune proves for
the first time that London in 1193 possessed a fully
<span class="sidenote">The Mayor and Échevins.</span>
developed &ldquo;Commune&rdquo; of the continental pattern. A
striking point in this municipal revolution is that the new
privileges extended to the city of London were entirely copied from
those of continental cities, and Mr Round shows that there is conclusive
proof of the assertion that the Commune of London derived
its origin from that of Rouen. This MS. gives us information which
was unknown before, but upsets the received opinions as to the early
governing position of the aldermen. From this we learn that the
government of the city was in the hands of a mayor and twelve
échevins (<i>skivini</i>); both these names being French, seem for a time
to have excluded the Saxon aldermen.</p>

<p>Twelve years later (1205-1206) we learn from another document,
preserved in the same volume as the oath, that <i>alii probi homines</i>
were associated with the mayor and échevins to form a body of
twenty-four (that is, twelve <i>skivini</i> and an equal number of
councillors). Round holds that the Court of Skivini and <i>alii
probi homines</i>, of which at present we know nothing further than
what is contained in the terms of the oaths, was the germ of the
Common Council. We must not suppose that when the city of
London obtained the privilege of appointing a mayor, and a citizen
could boast in 1194 that &ldquo;come what may the Londoners shall have
no king but their mayor,&rdquo; that the king did not occasionally exert his
power in suspending the liberties of the city. There were really
constant disagreements, and sometimes the king degraded the mayor
and appointed a custos or warden in his place. Several instances
of this are recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. It is very important
to bear in mind that the mayors of London besides holding a
very onerous position were mostly men of great distinction. They
often held rank outside the city, and naturally took their place among
the rulers of the country. They were mostly representatives of the
landed interests as well as merchant princes.</p>

<p>There is no definite information as to when the mayor first received
the title of lord. A claim has been set up for Thomas Legge, mayor
for the second time in 1354, that he was the first lord mayor, but there
is positively no authority whatever for this claim, although it is
boldly stated that he was created lord mayor by Edward III. in this
year. Apparently the title was occasionally used, and the use
gradually grew into a prescriptive right. There is no evidence of any
grant, but after 1540 the title had become general.</p>

<p>No record has been found of the date when the aldermen became
the official advisers of the mayor. The various wards were each
presided over by an alderman from an early period, but
we cannot fix the time when they were united as a court
<span class="sidenote">Aldermen.</span>
of aldermen. Stubbs writes: &ldquo;The governing body of London
in the 13th century was composed of the mayor, twenty-five
aldermen of the wards and two sheriffs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we do not find any further evidence than the oath of the
Commune alluded to of the existence of &ldquo;échevins&rdquo; in London, it
is possible that aldermen were elected on the mayor&rsquo;s council under
this title. This, however, is not the opinion of Mr Round, who, as before
stated, is inclined to believe that the body of échevins became in
course of time the Court of Common Council. The aldermen are
not mentioned as the colleagues of the mayor until the very end
of the 13th century, except in the case of Fitz-Ailwin&rsquo;s Assize of
1189, and this, of course, related specially to the duties of aldermen
as heads of the wards of the city.</p>

<p>In March 1298-1299 letters were sent from &ldquo;the Mayor and
Commune of the City of London&rdquo; to the municipalities of Bruges,
Caen and Cambray. Although the official form of &ldquo;The Mayor and
Commune&rdquo; was continued until the end of the 13th century, and it
was not until early in the 14th century that the form &ldquo;Mayor,
Aldermen and Common Council&rdquo; came into existence, there is
sufficient evidence to show that the aldermen and common council
before that time were acting with the mayor as governors of the city.
In 1377 it was ordered that aldermen could be elected annually, but
in 1384 the rule was modified so as to allow an alderman to be re-elected
for his ward at the expiration of his year of office without any
interval.</p>

<p>In 1394 the Ordinance respecting annual elections was repealed by
the king (Richard II.). Distinct rank was accorded to aldermen, and
in the <i>Liber Albus</i> we are told that &ldquo;it is a matter of experience that
ever since the year of our Lord 1350, at the sepulture of aldermen,
the ancient custom of interment with baronial honours was observed.&rdquo;
When the poll-tax of 1379 was imposed the mayor was
assessed as an earl and the aldermen as barons.</p>

<p>The government of the city by reeves dates back to a very early
period, and these reeves were appointed by the king. The prefix of
the various kinds of reeves made but little difference in the
duties of the office, although the area of these duties
<span class="sidenote">Sheriffs.</span>
might be different. There was slight difference between the office
of sheriff and that of portreeve, which latter does not appear to
have survived the Conquest.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Commune and the appointment of a
mayor the sheriffs naturally lost much of their importance, and they
became what they are styled in <i>Liber Albus</i> &ldquo;the Eyes of the
Mayor.&rdquo; When Middlesex was in farm to London the two sheriffs
were equally sheriffs of London and Middlesex. There is only one
instance in the city records of a sheriff of Middlesex being mentioned
as distinct from the sheriffs, and this was in 1283 when Anketin de
Betteville and Walter le Blond are described as sheriffs of London,
and Gerin as sheriff of Middlesex. By the Local Government Act of
1888 the citizens of London were deprived of all right of jurisdiction
over the county of Middlesex, which had been expressly granted by
various charters.</p>

<p>In 1383 it was ordained and agreed &ldquo;that no person shall from
henceforth be mayor in the said city if he have not first been sheriff
of the said city, to the end that he may be tried in governance and
bounty before he attains such estate of the mayoralty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two courts&mdash;that of aldermen and that of the common council&mdash;were
probably formed about the same time, but it is remarkable
that we have no definite information on the subject. The
number of members of the common council varied greatly
<span class="sidenote">Common Council.</span>
at different times, but the right to determine the number
was indirectly granted by the charter of Edward III. (1341) which
enables the city to amend customs and usages which have become
hard.</p>

<p>There have also been many changes in the mode of election. The
common council were chosen by the wards until 1351, when the
appointments were made by certain companies. In 1376 an ordinance
was made by the mayor and aldermen, with the assent of the
whole commons, to the effect that the companies should select men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page967" id="page967"></a>967</span>
with whom they were content, and none other should come to the
elections of mayors and sheriffs; that the greater companies should
not elect more than six, the lesser four and the least two. Forty-seven
companies nominated 156 members. In 1383 the right of
election reverted to the wards, but was obtained again by the livery
companies in 1467.</p>

<p>The Common Hall was the successor of the folkmote, the meetings
of which were originally held in the open air at the east end of St
Paul&rsquo;s and afterwards in the Guildhall. These general
assemblies of the citizens are described in the old city
<span class="sidenote">Common Hall.</span>
records as <i>immensa communitas</i> or <i>immensa multitudo</i>
civium. The elections in Common Hall were by the whole body of
citizens until Edward I.&rsquo;s reign, citizens were then specially summoned
to Common Hall by the mayor. In Edward IV.&rsquo;s reign the elections
of mayor, sheriffs and other officers and members of parliament were
transferred to liverymen. Various alterations were subsequently
made and now the qualification of electors at the election of the
corporate offices of lord mayor, sheriffs, chamberlain and minor
offices in Common Hall is that of being a liveryman of a livery
company and an enrolled freeman of London. The election of
aldermen and common councilmen takes place in the wardmotes.</p>

<p>The recorder, the chief official, is appointed for life. He was
formerly appointed by the city, but since the Local Government
Act of 1888 he is nominated by the city and approved by
<span class="sidenote">Officials of the city.</span>
the lord chancellor. The common sergeant was formerly
appointed by the city, but since 1888 by the lord
chancellor. The town clerk is appointed by the city and
re-elected annually.</p>

<p>The chamberlain or comptroller of the king&rsquo;s chamber is appointed
by the livery. He was originally a king&rsquo;s officer and the
office was probably instituted soon after the Conquest. The remembrancer
is appointed by the common council.</p>

<p>The common hunt, an office abolished in 1807, was filled by John
Courtenay in 1417. The sword-bearer is noticed in the <i>Liber Albus</i>
(1419) and the first record of an appointment is dated 1426.</p>

<p>Few fundamental alterations have been made in the constitution
of the city, but in the reign of Charles II. the most arbitrary proceedings
were taken against its liberties. The king and
his brother had long entertained designs against the city,
<span class="sidenote">Later history of the corporation.</span>
and for the purpose of crushing them two pretexts were
set up&mdash;(1) that a new rate of market tolls had been levied
by virtue of an act of common council, and (2) that a
petition to the king, in which it was alleged that by the prorogation
of parliament public justice had been interrupted, had been printed
by order of the Court of Common Council. Charles directed a writ
<i>quo warranto</i> against the corporation of London in 1683, and the
Court of King&rsquo;s Bench declared its charter forfeited. Soon afterwards
all the obnoxious aldermen were displaced and others appointed
in their room by royal commission. When James II. found himself
in danger from the landing of the Prince of Orange he sent for the
lord mayor and aldermen and informed them of his determination
to restore the city charter and privileges, but he had no time to do
anything before his flight. The Convention which was summoned to
meet on the 22nd of January 1689 was converted by a formal act
into a true parliament (February 23). One of the first motions put
to the House was that a special Committee should be appointed to
consider the violations of the liberties and franchises of all the
corporations of the kingdom &ldquo;and particularly of the City of
London.&rdquo; The motion was lost but the House resolved to bring in a
bill for repealing the Corporation Act, and ten years later (March 5)
the Grand Committee of Grievances reported to the House its
opinion (1) that the rights of the City of London in the election of
sheriffs in the year 1682 were invaded and that such invasion was
illegal and a grievance, and (2) that the judgment given upon the
<i>Quo Warranto</i> against the city was illegal and a grievance. The
committee&rsquo;s opinion on these two points (among others) was endorsed
by the House and on the 16th of March it ordered a Bill
to be brought in to restore all corporations to the state and condition
they were in on the 29th of May 1660, and to confirm the
liberties and franchises which at that time they respectively held
and enjoyed.<a name="fa15f" id="fa15f" href="#ft15f"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

<p>When the Act for the reform of Municipal Corporations was
passed in 1835 London was specially excepted from its provisions.
When the Metropolitan Board of Works was formed by the
Metropolis Management Act of 1855 the city was affected to a certain
extent, but by the Local Government Act of 1888 which founded the
London County Council the right of appointing a sheriff for Middlesex
was taken away from the city of London.</p>

<p>When the county of Middlesex was dissociated from the city of
London one portion was joined to the administrative county of
London, and the other to the county of Middlesex.</p>

<p>The lord mayor of London has certain very remarkable privileges
which have been religiously guarded and must be of great antiquity.
<span class="sidenote">Privileges of the lord mayor.</span>
It is only necessary to mention these here, but each
of the privileges requires an exhaustive examination
as to its origin. They all prove the remarkable position
of Old London, and mark it off from all other cities
of modern Europe. Shortly stated the privileges are four:</p>

<div class="list">
<p style="clear: both;">1. The closing of Temple Bar to the sovereign.</p>

<p>2. The mayor&rsquo;s position in the city, where he is second only to the
king.</p>

<p>3. His summons to the Privy Council on the accession of a new
sovereign.</p>

<p>4. His position of butler at the coronation banquets.</p>
</div>

<p>The last may be considered in abeyance as there has not been
any coronation banquet since that of George IV. In the case
of the coronation of King Edward VII. the claim was excluded
from the consideration of the Court of Claims under the royal
proclamation. The terms of the judgment on a further claim
are as follows: &ldquo;The Court considers and adjudges that the lord
mayor has by usage a right, subject to His Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure,
to attend the Abbey during the coronation and bear the crystal
mace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The earliest description of London is that written
by the monk Fitzstephen in 1174 as an introduction to his life of
Archbishop Thomas à Becket. This was first printed by Stow in his
Survey. It was reprinted by Strype in his editions of Stow; by
Hearne in his edition of Leland&rsquo;s <i>Itinerary</i> (vol. 8), by Samuel
Pegge in 1772, and elsewhere. The first history is contained in

in 1605, and his work was continued by Anthony Munday and others
(1618, 1633) and in the next century by John Strype (1720, 1754-1755).
Stow&rsquo;s original work was reprinted by W. J. Thoms in 1842

<p><span class="bold">LONDON CLAY,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> in geology, the most important member
of the Lower Eocene strata in the south of England. It is well
developed in the London basin, though not frequently exposed,
partly because it is to a great extent covered by more recent
gravels and partly because it is not often worked on a large
scale. It is a stiff, tenacious, bluish clay that becomes brown
on weathering, occasionally it becomes distinctly sandy, sometimes
glauconitic, especially towards the top; large calcareous
septarian concretions are common, and have been used in the
manufacture of cement, being dug for this purpose at Sheppey,
near Southend, and at Harwich, and dredged off the Hampshire
coast. Nodular lumps of pyrites and crystals of selenite
are of frequent occurrence. The clay has been employed for
making bricks, tiles and coarse pottery, but it is usually too
tenacious for this purpose except in well-weathered or sandy
portions. The base of the clay is very regularly indicated by
a few inches of rounded flint pebbles with green and yellowish
sand, parts of this layer being frequently cemented by carbonate
of lime. The average thickness of the London Clay in
the London basin is about 450 ft.; at Windsor it is 400 ft.
thick; beneath London it is rather thicker, while in the south
of Essex it is over 480 ft. In Wiltshire it only reaches a few feet
in thickness, while in Berkshire it is some 50 or 60 ft. It is found
in the Isle of Wight, where it is 300 ft. thick at Whitecliff Bay&mdash;here
the beds are vertical and even slightly reversed&mdash;and in
Alum Bay it is 220 ft. thick. In Hampshire it is sometimes
known as the Bognor Beds, and certain layers of calcareous
sandstone within the clays are called Barnes or Bognor Rock.
In the eastern part of the London basin in east Kent the pebbly
basement bed becomes a thick deposit (60 ft.), forming part of
the Oldhaven and Blackheath Beds.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The London Clay is a marine deposit, and its fossils indicate a
moderately warm climate, the flora having a tropical aspect. Among
the fossils may be mentioned <i>Panopoea intermedia</i>, <i>Ditrupa plana</i>,
<i>Teredina personata</i>, <i>Conus concinnus</i>, <i>Rostellaria ampla</i>, <i>Nautilus
centralis</i>, <i>Belosepia</i>, foraminifera and diatoms. Fish remains include
<i>Otodus obliquus</i>, <i>Sphyroenodus crassidens</i>; birds are represented by
<i>Halcyornis Toliapicus</i>, <i>Lithornis</i> and <i>Odontopteryx</i>, and reptiles by
<i>Chelone gigas</i>, and other turtles, <i>Palaeophis</i>, a serpent and crocodiles.
<i>Hyracotherium leporinum</i>, <i>Palaeotherium</i> and a few other mammals
are recorded. Plant remains in a pyritized condition are found in
great abundance and perfection on the shore of Sheppey; numerous
species of palms, screw pines, water lilies, cypresses, yews, leguminous
plants and many others occur; logs of coniferous wood bored through
by annelids and <i>Teredo</i> are common, and fossil resin has been found
at Highgate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONDONDERRY, EARLS AND MARQUESSES OF.<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> The
1st earl of Londonderry was Thomas Ridgeway (<i>c.</i> 1565-1631),
a Devon man, who was treasurer in Ireland from 1606 to 1616
and was engaged in the plantation of Ulster. Ridgeway was
made a baronet in 1611, Baron Ridgeway in 1616 and earl of
Londonderry in 1623. The Ridgeways held the earldom until
March 1714, when Robert, the 4th earl, died without sons. In
1726 Robert&rsquo;s son-in-law, Thomas Pitt (<i>c.</i> 1688-1729), son of
Thomas Pitt, &ldquo;Diamond Pitt,&rdquo; governor at Madras and uncle
of the great earl of Chatham, was created earl of Londonderry,
the earldom again becoming extinct when his younger son
Ridgeway, the 3rd earl of this line, died unmarried in January
1765. In 1796 Robert Stewart (1739-1821), of Mount Stewart,
Co. Down, was made earl of Londonderry in the Irish peerage.
He had been created Baron Londonderry in 1789 and Viscount
Castlereagh in 1795; in 1816 he was advanced to the rank of
marquess of Londonderry. The 3rd marquess married the
heiress of the Vane-Tempests and took the name of Vane instead
of Stewart; the 5th marquess called himself Vane-Tempest
and the 6th marquess Vane-Tempest-Stewart.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONDONDERRY, CHARLES WILLIAM STEWART (VANE),<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span>
<span class="sc">3rd Marquess of</span> (1778-1854), British soldier and diplomatist,
was the son of the 1st marquess by a second marriage with the
daughter of the 1st Earl Camden. He entered the army and
served in the Netherlands (1794), on the Rhine and Danube
(1795), in the Irish rebellion (1798), and Holland (1799), rising
to be colonel; and having been elected to parliament for Kerry
he became under secretary for war under his half-brother
Castlereagh in 1807. In 1808 he was given a cavalry command
in the Peninsula, where he brilliantly distinguished himself.
In 1809, and again in the campaigns of 1810, 1811, having
become a major-general, he served under Wellington in the
Peninsula as his adjutant-general, and was at the capture of
Ciudad Rodrigo, but at the beginning of 1812 he was invalided
home. Castlereagh (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Londonderry</a></span>, 2nd Marquess of)
then sent him to Berlin as minister, to represent Great Britain
in the allied British, Russian and Prussian armies; and as a
cavalry leader he played an important part in the subsequent
fighting, while ably seconding Castlereagh&rsquo;s diplomacy. In
1814 he was made a peer as Baron Stewart, and later in the
year was appointed ambassador at Vienna, and was a member
of the important congresses which followed. In 1822 his half-brother&rsquo;s
death made him 3rd marquess of Londonderry, and
shortly afterwards, disagreeing with Canning, he resigned,
being created Earl Vane (1823), and for some years lived quietly
in England, improving his Seaham estates. In 1835 he was for
a short time ambassador at St Petersburg. In 1852, after the
death of Wellington, when he was one of the pall-bearers, he
received the order of the Garter. He died on the 6th of March
1854. He was twice married, first in 1808 to the daughter of the
earl of Darnley, and secondly in 1819 to the heiress of Sir Harry
Vane-Tempest (a descendant of Sir Piers Tempest, who served
at Agincourt, and heir to Sir Henry Vane, Bart.), when he
assumed the name of Vane. Frederick William Robert (1805-1872),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page969" id="page969"></a>969</span>
his son by the first marriage, became 4th marquess; and
on the latter&rsquo;s death in 1872, George Henry (1821-1884), the
eldest son by the second marriage, after succeeding as Earl
Vane (according to the patent of 1823), became 5th marquess.
In 1884 he was succeeded as 6th marquess by his son Charles
Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart (b. 1852), a prominent Conservative
politician, who was viceroy of Ireland (1886-1889), chairman
of the London School Board (1895-1897), postmaster-general
(1900-1902), president of the Board of Education (1902-1905)
and lord president of the Council (1903-1905).</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LONDONDERRY, ROBERT STEWART,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> <span class="sc">2nd Marquess of</span>
(1769-1822), British statesman, was the eldest son of Robert
Stewart of Ballylawn Castle, in Donegal, and Mount Stewart
in Down, an Ulster landowner, of kin to the Galloway Stewarts,
who became baron, viscount, earl and marquess in the peerage
of Ireland. The son, known in history as Lord Castlereagh, was
born on the 18th of June in the same year as Napoleon and
Wellington. His mother was Lady Sarah Seymour, daughter of
the earl of Hertford. He went from Armagh school to St John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, but left at the end of his first year. With
Lord Downshire, then holding sway over the County Down,
Lord Stewart had a standing feud, and he put forward his son,
in July 1790, for one of the seats. Young Stewart was returned,
but at a vast cost to his family, when he was barely twenty-one.
He took his seat in the Irish House of Commons at the same
time as his friend, Arthur Wellesley, M.P. for Trim, but sat later
for two close boroughs in England, still remaining member
for Down at College Green.</p>

<p>From 1796, when his father became an earl, he took the
courtesy title of Viscount Castlereagh, and becoming keeper of
the privy seal in Ireland, he acted as chief secretary, during the
prolonged absence of Mr Pelham, from February 1797. Castlereagh&rsquo;s
conviction was that, in presence of threatened invasion
and rebellion, Ireland could only be made safe by union with
Great Britain. In Lord Camden, as afterwards in Lord Cornwallis,
Castlereagh found a congenial chief; though his favour
with these statesmen was jealously viewed both by the Irish
oligarchy and by the English politicians who wished to keep
the machine of Irish administration in their own hands. Pitt
himself was doubtful of the expediency of making an Irishman
chief secretary, but his view was changed by the influence of
Cornwallis. In suppressing Lord Edward Fitzgerald&rsquo;s conspiracy,
and the rebellion which followed in 1798, Castlereagh&rsquo;s
vigilance and firmness were invaluable. His administration
was denounced by a faction as harsh and cruel&mdash;a charge afterwards
repudiated by Grattan and Plunket&mdash;but he was always
on the side of lenity. The disloyal in Ireland, both Jacobins
and priest-led, the Protestant zealots and others who feared
the consequence of the Union, coalesced against him in Dublin.
Even there Castlereagh, though defeated in a first campaign
(1799), impressed Pitt with his ability and tact, with Cornwallis
he joined in holding out, during the second Union campaign
(1800), the prospect of emancipation to the Roman Catholics.
They were aided by free expenditure of money and promises
of honours, methods too familiar in Irish politics. When the
Act of Union was carried through the Irish parliament, in the
summer of 1800, Castlereagh&rsquo;s official connexion with his native
land practically ended. Before the Imperial Parliament met
he urged upon Pitt the measures which he and Cornwallis thought
requisite to make the Union effective. In spite of his services
and of Pitt&rsquo;s support, disillusion awaited him. The king&rsquo;s
reluctance to yield to the Roman Catholic claims was underestimated
by Pitt, while Cornwallis imprudently permitted
himself to use language which, though not amounting to a pledge,
was construed as one. George III. resented the arguments
brought forward by Castlereagh&mdash;&ldquo;this young man&rdquo; who had
come over to talk him out of his coronation oath. He peremptorily
refused to sanction emancipation, and Pitt and his cabinet
made way for the Addington administration. Thereupon
Castlereagh resigned, with Cornwallis. He took his seat at
Westminster for Down, the constituency he had represented
for ten years in Dublin. The leadership of an Irish party was
offered to him, but he declined so to limit his political activity.
His father accepted, at Portland&rsquo;s request, an Irish marquessate,
on the understanding that in the future he or his heirs might
claim the same rank in the Imperial Legislature; so that
Castlereagh was able to sit in the House of Commons as Marquess
in 1821-1822. Wilberforce discussed with Pitt the possibility
of sending out Castlereagh to India as governor-general, when
the friction between Lord Wellesley and the directors became
grave; but Pitt objected, as the plan would remove Castlereagh
from the House of Commons, which should be &ldquo;the theatre of
his future fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1802, Castlereagh, at Pitt&rsquo;s suggestion, became president
of the Board of Control in the Addington cabinet. He had,
though not in office, taken charge of Irish measures under
Addington, including the repression of the Rebellion Bill, and
the temporary suspension of the Habeas Corpus in 1801, and
continued to advocate Catholic relief, tithe reform, state payment
of Catholic and dissenting clergy and &ldquo;the steady application
of authority in support of the laws.&rdquo; To Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s
Indian policy he gave a staunch support, warmly recognized
by the governor-general. On Pitt&rsquo;s return to office (May 1804),
Castlereagh retained his post, and, next year, took over also the
duties of secretary for war and the colonies. Socially and
politically, the gifts of his wife, Lady Emily Hobart, daughter
of a former Irish viceroy, whom he had married in 1794, assisted
him to make his house a meeting-place of the party; and his
influence in parliament grew notwithstanding his defects of
style, spoken and written. As a manager of men he had no equal.
After Pitt&rsquo;s death his surviving colleagues failed to form a cabinet
strong enough to face the formidable combination known as
&ldquo;All the Talents,&rdquo; and Castlereagh acquiesced in the resignation.
But to the foreign policy of the Fox-Greville ministry and its
conduct of the war he was always opposed. His objections to
the Whig doctrine of withdrawal from &ldquo;Continental entanglements&rdquo;
and to the reduction of military expenditure were
justified when Fox himself was compelled &ldquo;to nail his country&rsquo;s
colours to the mast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cabinet of &ldquo;All the Talents,&rdquo; weakened by the death of
Fox and the renewed quarrel with the king, went out in April
1807. Castlereagh returned to the War Office under Portland,
but grave difficulties arose, though Canning at the Foreign
Office was then thoroughly at one with him. A priceless opportunity
had been missed after Eylau. The Whigs had crippled the
transport service, and the operations to avert the ruin of the
coalition at Friedland came too late. The Tsar Alexander
believed that England would no longer concern herself with the
Continental struggle, and Friedland was followed by Tilsit.
The secret articles of that compact, denied at the time by the
Opposition and by French apologists, have now been revealed
from official records in M. Vandal&rsquo;s work, <i>Napoléon et Alexandre</i>.
Castlereagh and Canning saw the vital importance of nullifying
the aim of this project. The seizure of the Danish squadron
at Copenhagen, and the measures taken to rescue the fleets of
Portugal and Sweden from Napoleon, crushed a combination
as menacing as that defeated at Trafalgar. The expedition to
Portugal, though Castlereagh&rsquo;s influence was able only to secure
Arthur Wellesley a secondary part at first, soon dwarfed other
issues. In the debates on the Convention of Cintra, Castlereagh
defended Wellesley against parliamentary attacks: &ldquo;A brother,&rdquo;
the latter wrote, &ldquo;could not have done more.&rdquo; The depression
produced by Moore&rsquo;s campaign in northern Spain, and the king&rsquo;s
repugnance to the Peninsular operations, seemed to cut short
Wellesley&rsquo;s career; but early in 1809, Castlereagh, with no little
difficulty, secured his friend&rsquo;s appointment as commander-in-chief
of the second Portuguese expedition. The merit has been
claimed for Canning by Stapleton, but the evidence is all the
other way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Castlereagh&rsquo;s policy led to a crisis that clouded his
own fortunes. The breach between him and Canning was not due
to his incompetence in the conduct of the Walcheren expedition,
In fact, Castlereagh&rsquo;s ejection was decided by Canning&rsquo;s
intrigues, though concealed from the victim, months before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page970" id="page970"></a>970</span>
the armament was sent out to the Scheldt. In the selection of
the earl of Chatham as commander the king&rsquo;s personal preference
was known, but there is evidence also that it was one of Canning&rsquo;s
schemes, as he reckoned, if Chatham succeeded, on turning him
into a convenient ministerial figurehead. Canning was not
openly opposed to the Walcheren expedition, and on the Peninsular
question he mainly differed from Castlereagh and Wellington
in fixing his hopes on national enthusiasm and popular uprisings.
Military opinion is generally agreed that the plan of striking
from Walcheren at Antwerp, the French naval base, was sound.
Napoleon heard the news with dismay; in principle Wellington
approved the plan. Castlereagh&rsquo;s proposal was for a <i>coup de
main</i>, under strict conditions of celerity and secrecy, as Antwerp
was unable to make any adequate defence. But Chatham, the
naval authorities and the cabinet proceeded with a deliberation
explained by the fact that the war secretary had been condemned
in secret. The expedition, planned at the end of March,
did not reach Walcheren till the end of July 1809; and more
time was lost in movements against Batz and Flushing, protracted
until an unhealthy autumn prostrated the army, which
was withdrawn, discredited and disabled, in September. Public
opinion threw the whole blame upon Castlereagh, who then found
that, in deference to Canning, his colleagues had decreed his
removal half a year earlier, though they kept silence till the
troops were brought back from Walcheren. When Castlereagh
learned from Percival that the slur cast on him had its origin
in a secret attack on him many months before, he was cruelly
hurt. The main charge against him was, he says, that he would
not throw over officers on whom unpopularity fell, at the first
shadow of ill-fortune. His refusal to rush into censure of Moore,
following Canning&rsquo;s sudden change from eulogy to denunciation,
requires no defence. According to the ideas then prevailing
Castlereagh held himself justified in sending a challenge to the
original author, as he held, of a disloyal intrigue against a colleague.
In the subsequent duel Canning was wounded and the
rivals simultaneously resigned. In private letters to his father
and brother, Castlereagh urged that he was bound to show that
he &ldquo;was not privy to his own disgrace.&rdquo; When Canning published
a lengthy explanation of his conduct, many who had sided
with him were convinced that Castlereagh had been much
wronged. The excuse that the protest upon which the cabinet
decided against Castlereagh did not mention the minister&rsquo;s
name was regarded as a quibble. Men widely differing in character
and opinions&mdash;Walter Scott, Sidney Smith, Brougham and
Cobbett&mdash;took this view. Castlereagh loyally supported the
government in parliament, after Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s appointment
to the Foreign Office. Though Wellington&rsquo;s retreat after Talavera
had been included, with the disasters of the Corunna and Walcheren
campaigns, in the censures on Castlereagh, and though
ministers were often depressed and doubtful, Castlereagh never
lost faith in Wellington&rsquo;s genius. Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s resignation
in 1812, when the Whigs failed to come to terms with the regent,
led to Castlereagh&rsquo;s return to office as foreign secretary (March
1812). The assassination of Percival soon threw upon him the
leadership of the House of Commons, and this double burden
he continued to bear during the rest of his life.</p>

<p>From March 1812 to July 1822 Castlereagh&rsquo;s biography is, in
truth, the history of England. Though never technically prime
minister, during these years he wielded a power such as few
ministers have exercised. Political opponents and personal ill-wishers
admitted that he was the ablest leader who ever controlled
the House of Commons for so long a period. As a diplomatist,
nobody save Marlborough had the same influence over
men or was given equal freedom by his colleagues at home.
Foreigners saw in him the living presence of England in the camp
of the Allies. At the War Office he had been hampered by the lack
of technical knowledge, while nature had not granted him, as
an organizer, the powers of a Carnot or Roon. But in diplomacy
his peculiar combination of strength and charm, of patience and
conciliatory adroitness, was acknowledged by all. At the
Foreign Office he set himself at once to meet Napoleon&rsquo;s designs
in northern Europe, where Russia was preparing for her life-and-death
struggle. Lord Wellesley paid a high tribute to
Castlereagh&rsquo;s conduct in this situation, and Wellington declared
that he had then &ldquo;rendered to the world the most important
service that ever fell to the lot of any individual to perform.&rdquo;
Castlereagh wisely rejected Napoleon&rsquo;s insincere overtures for
peace. After the Moscow <i>débâcle</i> Napoleon&rsquo;s fate was affected
not only by Wellington&rsquo;s progress in Spain, but by the attitude
of the northern powers and by the action of Turkey, due to
Castlereagh&rsquo;s opportune disclosure to the Porte of the scheme
of partition at Tilsit. At home, the repeal of the Orders in
Council was carried, the damage to British trade plainly outweighing
the injury inflicted on France by the restrictive system.
The British subsidies to the Allies were largely increased as the
operations of 1813 developed, but all Castlereagh&rsquo;s skill was
needed to keep the Coalition together. The Allied powers were
willing, even after Leipzig, to treat with France on the basis of
restoring her &ldquo;natural frontiers&rdquo;&mdash;the Rhine, the Alps and the
Pyrenees; but Castlereagh protested. He would not allow the
enemy to take ground for another tiger-spring. Before the Conference
of Châtillon, where Napoleon sent Caulaincourt to
negotiate for peace&mdash;with the message scribbled on the margin
of his instructions, &ldquo;Ne signez rien&rdquo;&mdash;Aberdeen wrote to
hasten Castlereagh&rsquo;s coming: &ldquo;Everything which has been so
long smothered is now bursting forth&rdquo;; and again, &ldquo;Your
presence has done much and would, I have no doubt, continue
to sustain them (the Allies) in misfortune.&rdquo; The Liverpool
cabinet then and later were as urgent in pressing him to return
to lead the House of Commons. He had lost his seat for Down
in 1805, and afterwards sat for British boroughs; but in 1812
he was re-elected by his old constituents; and again in 1818 and
1820, sitting, after he became marquess of Londonderry in 1821,
for Orford. Early in 1814 his colleagues reluctantly consented
to his visit to the allied headquarters. The Great Alliance
showed signs of weakness and division. Austria was holding
back; Prussia had almost broken away; above all, the ambiguous
conduct of Alexander bred alarm and doubt. This
situation became increasingly serious while Napoleon was giving
daily proofs that his military genius, confronting a hesitant and
divided enemy, was at its best. Castlereagh strove to keep the
Allies together, to give no excuse for those separate arrangements
upon which Napoleon was reckoning, to assert no selfish
policy for England, to be tied by no theoretical consistency.
At the Châtillon conferences England was represented by others,
but Castlereagh was present with supreme authority over all,
and it was he who determined the result. He declined to commit
his country either to a blank refusal to negotiate with Napoleon
or to the advocacy of a Bourbon restoration. He was ready to
give up almost the whole of England&rsquo;s conquests, but he insisted
on the return of France within her ancient limits as the basis of a
settlement. Caulaincourt&rsquo;s advice was to take advantage of
these overtures; but his master was not to be advised. The
counter-projects that he urged Caulaincourt to submit to were
advanced after his victory at Montereau, when he boasted that
he was nearer to Munich than the Allies were to Paris. Even
before the Châtillon conference was dissolved (March 18th),
Castlereagh saw that Caulaincourt&rsquo;s efforts would never bend
Napoleon&rsquo;s will. The Allies adopted his view and signed the
treaty of Chaumont (March 1st), &ldquo;my treaty,&rdquo; as Castlereagh
called it, with an unusual touch of personal pride; adding
&ldquo;Upon the face of the treaty this year our engagement is
equivalent to theirs united.&rdquo; The power of England when she
threw her purse into the scale had been just exhibited at Bar-sur-Aube,
when at a council of all the representatives of the
powers the retreat of the allied armies was discussed. Bernadotte,
playing a waiting game in Holland, was unwilling to
reinforce Blücher, then in a dangerous position, by the Russian
and Prussian divisions of Winzingerode and Bülow, temporarily
placed under his orders. Having asked for and received the
assurance that the military leaders were agreed in holding the
transfer necessary, Castlereagh declared that he took upon
himself the responsibility of bringing the Swedish prince to
reason. The withholding of the British subsidies was a vital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page971" id="page971"></a>971</span>
matter, not only with Bernadotte but with all the powers.
Castlereagh&rsquo;s avowed intention to take this step without waiting
for sanction from his cabinet put an end to evasion and delay.
Blücher was reinforced by the two divisions; the battle of Laon
was fought and won, and the allies occupied the French capital.
In April 1814 Castlereagh arrived in Paris. He did not disguise
his discontent with Napoleon&rsquo;s position at Elba, close to the
French coast, though he advised England not to separate
herself at this crisis from her allies. His uneasiness led him to
summon Wellington from the south to the Embassy in Paris.
He hastened himself to London during the visit of the allied
sovereigns, and met with a splendid reception. He was honoured
with the Garter, being one of the few commoners ever admitted
to that order. When the House of Commons offered to the Crown
its congratulations upon the treaty of peace, Castlereagh&rsquo;s
triumph was signalized by a brilliantly eloquent panegyric
from Canning, and by a recantation of his former doubts and
denunciations from Whitbread. His own dignified language
vindicated his country from the charge of selfish ambition.</p>

<p>His appointment as British representative at Vienna, where the
congress was to meet in September, was foreseen; but meanwhile
he was not idle. The war with the United States, originating in
the non-intercourse dispute and the Orders in Council, did not
cease with the repeal of the latter. It lasted through 1814 till
the signing of the treaty of Ghent, soon before the flight from
Elba. In parliament the ministry, during Castlereagh&rsquo;s absence,
had been poorly championed. Canning had thrown away his
chance by his unwise refusal of the Foreign Office. None of the
ministers had any pretension to lead when Castlereagh was busy
abroad and Canning was sulking at home, and Castlereagh&rsquo;s
letters to Vansittart, the chancellor of the exchequer, show
how these difficulties weighed upon him in facing the position at
Vienna, where it was imperative for him to appear. At Vienna
he realized at once that the ambition of Russia might be as
formidable to Europe and to Great Britain as that of the fallen
tyrant. His aim throughout had been to rescue Europe from
military domination; and when he found that Russia and Prussia
were pursuing ends incompatible with the general interest, he
did not hesitate to take a new line. He brought about the secret
treaty (Jan. 3, 1815) between Great Britain, Austria and France,
directed against the plans of Russia in Poland and of Prussia in
Saxony. Through Castlereagh&rsquo;s efforts, the Polish and Saxon
questions were settled on the basis of compromise. The threat
of Russian interference in the Low Countries was dropped.</p>

<p>While the Congress was still unfinished, Napoleon&rsquo;s escape
from Elba came like a thunderclap. Castlereagh had come
home for a short visit (Feb. 1815), at the urgent request of the
cabinet, just before the flight was known. The shock revived
the Great Alliance under the compact of Chaumont. All energies
were directed to preparing for the campaign of Waterloo. Castlereagh&rsquo;s
words in parliament were, &ldquo;Whatever measures you
adopt or decision you arrive at must rest on your own power
and not on reliance on this man.&rdquo; Napoleon promptly published
the secret treaty which Castlereagh had concluded with Metternich
and Talleyrand, and the last left in the French archives.
But Russia and Prussia, though much displeased, saw that, in
the face of Bonaparte&rsquo;s return, they dared not weaken the
Alliance. British subsidies were again poured out like water.
After Napoleon&rsquo;s overthrow, Castlereagh successfully urged his
removal to St Helena, where his custodians were charged to treat
him &ldquo;with all the respect due to his rank, but under such precautions
as should render his escape a matter of impossibility.&rdquo;
Some of the continental powers demanded, after Waterloo, fines
and cessions that would have crushed France; but in November a
peace was finally concluded, mainly by Castlereagh&rsquo;s endeavours,
minimising the penalties exacted, and abandoning on England&rsquo;s
part the whole of her share of the indemnity. The war created
an economic situation at home which strengthened the Whigs
and Radicals, previously discredited by their hostility to a
patriotic struggle. In 1816 the Income Tax was remitted,
despite Castlereagh&rsquo;s contention that something should first be
done to reduce the Debt Charge. His policy, impressed upon
British representatives abroad, was &ldquo;to turn the confidence
Great Britain inspired to the account of peace, by exercising a
conciliatory influence in Europe.&rdquo; Brougham&rsquo;s action, at the
end of 1815, denouncing the Holy Alliance, even in its early
form, was calculated to embarrass England, though she was no
party to what Castlereagh described as a &ldquo;piece of sublime
mysticism and nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he saw no reason in this for breaking up the Grand
Alliance, which he looked upon as a convenient organ of diplomatic
intercourse and as essential for the maintenance of peace,
he regarded with alarm &ldquo;the little spirit of German intrigue,&rdquo;
and agreed with Wellington that to attempt to crush France,
as the Prussians desired, or to keep her in a perpetual condition
of tutelage under a European concert from which she herself
should be excluded, would be to invite the very disaster which it
was the object of the Alliance to avoid. It was not till Metternich&rsquo;s
idea of extending the scope of the Alliance, by using it to
crush &ldquo;the revolution&rdquo; wherever it should raise its head, began
to take shape, from the conference of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)
onward, that Great Britain&rsquo;s separation from her continental
allies became inevitable. Against this policy of the reactionary
powers Castlereagh from the first vigorously protested. As
little was he prepared to accept the visionary schemes of the
emperor Alexander for founding an effective &ldquo;confederation of
Europe&rdquo; upon the inclusive basis of the Holy Alliance (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alexander I</a></span>. of Russia).</p>

<p>Meanwhile financial troubles at home, complicated by the
resumption of cash payments in 1819, led to acute social tension.
&ldquo;Peterloo&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Six Acts&rdquo; were furiously denounced,
though the bills introduced by Sidmouth and Castlereagh were
carried in both Houses by overwhelming majorities. The danger
that justified them was proved beyond contest by the Cato
Street Conspiracy in 1820. It is now admitted by Liberal
writers that the &ldquo;Six Acts,&rdquo; in the circumstances, were reasonable
and necessary. Throughout, Castlereagh maintained his
tranquil ascendancy in the House of Commons, though he had
few colleagues who were capable of standing up against
Brougham. Canning, indeed, had returned to office and had defended
the &ldquo;Six Acts,&rdquo; but Castlereagh bore the whole burden of
parliamentary leadership, as well as the enormous responsibilities
of the Foreign Office. His appetite for work caused him to engage
in debates and enquiries on financial and legal questions when he
might have delegated the task to others. Althorp was struck with
his unsleeping energy on the Agricultural Distress Committee;
&ldquo;His exertions, coupled with his other duties&mdash;and unfortunately
he was always obstinate in refusing assistance&mdash;strained his
constitution fearfully, as was shown by his careworn brow and
increasing paleness.&rdquo; In 1821, on Sidmouth&rsquo;s retirement, he
took upon himself the laborious functions of the Home Office.
The diplomatic situation had become serious. The policy
of &ldquo;intervention,&rdquo; with which Great Britain had consistently
refused to identify herself, had been proclaimed to the world
by the famous Troppau Protocol, signed by Russia, Austria and
Prussia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Troppau, Congress of</a></span>). The immediate occasion
was the revolution at Naples, where the egregious Spanish
constitution of 1812 had been forced on the king by a military
rising. With military revolts, as with paper constitutions
of an unworkable type, Castlereagh had no sympathy; and in
this particular case the revolution, in his opinion, was wholly
without excuse or palliation. He was prepared to allow the
intervention of Austria, if she considered her rights under the
treaty of 1813 violated, or her position as an Italian Power
imperilled. But he protested against the general claim, embodied
in the Protocol, of the European powers to interfere, uninvited,
in the internal concerns of sovereign states; he refused to make
Great Britain, even tacitly, a party to such interference, and
again insisted that her part in the Alliance was defined by the
letter of the treaties, beyond which she was not prepared to go.
In no case, he affirmed, would Great Britain &ldquo;undertake the
moral responsibility for administering a general European
police,&rdquo; which she would never tolerate as applied to herself.</p>

<p>To Troppau, accordingly, no British plenipotentiary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page972" id="page972"></a>972</span>
sent, since the outcome of the conferences was a foregone conclusion;
though Lord Stewart came from Vienna to watch the
course of events. At Laibach an attempt to revive the Troppau
proposals was defeated by the firm opposition of Stewart; but
a renewal of the struggle at Verona in the autumn of 1822 was
certain. Castlereagh, now marquess of Londonderry, was again
to be the British representative, and he drew up for himself
instructions that were handed over unaltered by Canning, his
successor at the Foreign Office, to the new plenipotentiary,
Wellington. In the threatened intervention of the continental
powers in Spain, as in their earlier action towards Naples and
Sardinia, England refused to take part. The Spanish revolutionary
movement, Castlereagh wrote, &ldquo;was a matter with
which, in the opinion of the English cabinet, no foreign power
had the smallest right to interfere.&rdquo; Before, however, the
question of intervention in Spain had reached its most critical
stage the development of the Greek insurrection against the
Ottoman government brought up the Eastern Question in an
acute form, which profoundly modified the relations of the
powers within the Alliance, and again drew Metternich and
Castlereagh together in common dread of an isolated attack
by Russia upon Turkey. A visit of King George IV. to Hanover,
in October 1821, was made the occasion of a meeting between
Lord Londonderry and the Austrian chancellor. A meeting
so liable to misinterpretation was in Castlereagh&rsquo;s opinion
justified by the urgency of the crisis in the East, &ldquo;a practical
consideration of the greatest moment,&rdquo; which had nothing in
common with the objectionable &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; question with
which the British government had refused to concern itself.
Yet Castlereagh, on this occasion, showed that he could use the
theories of others for his own practical ends; and he joined
cordially with Metternich in taking advantage of the emperor
Alexander&rsquo;s devotion to the principles of the Alliance to prevent
his taking an independent line in the Eastern Question. It was,
indeed, the belief that this question would be made the matter of
common discussion at the congress that led Castlereagh to agree
to be present at Verona; and in his <i>Instructions</i> he foreshadowed
the policy afterwards carried out by Canning, pointing out that
the development of the war had made the recognition of the
belligerent rights of the Greeks inevitable, and quoting the
precedent of the Spanish American colonies as exactly applicable.
With regard to the Spanish colonies, moreover, though he was
not as yet prepared to recognize their independence <i>de jure</i>,
he was strongly of opinion that the Spanish government should
do so since &ldquo;other states would acknowledge them sooner or
later, and it is to the interest of Spain herself to find the means
of restoring an intercourse when she cannot succeed in restoring
a dominion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the tragic ending of Castlereagh&rsquo;s strenuous life was
near; and the credit of carrying out the policy foreshadowed
in the <i>Instructions</i> was to fall to his rival Canning. Lord
Londonderry&rsquo;s exhaustion became evident during the toilsome
session of 1822. Both the king and Wellington were struck by
his overwrought condition, which his family attributed to
an attack of the gout and the lowering remedies employed.
Wellington warned Dr Bankhead that Castlereagh was unwell,
and, perhaps, mentally disordered. Bankhead went down to
North Cray and took due precautions. Castlereagh&rsquo;s razors
were taken away, but a penknife was forgotten in a drawer,
and with this he cut his throat (August 12, 1822). He had just
before said, &ldquo;My mind, my mind, is, as it were, gone&rdquo;; and,
when he saw his wife and Bankhead talking together, he moaned
&ldquo;there is a conspiracy laid against me.&rdquo; It was as clear a case
of brain disease as any on record. But this did not prevent his
enemies of the baser sort from asserting, without a shadow of
proof, that the suicide was caused by terror at some hideous and
undefined charge. The testimony of statesmen of the highest
character and of all parties to Castlereagh&rsquo;s gifts and charm is in
strong contrast with the flood of vituperation and calumny
poured out upon his memory by those who knew him not.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;Castlereagh&rsquo;s correspondence and papers were
published by his brother and successor (1850-1853) in twelve
volumes. Sir Archibald Alison&rsquo;s <i>Biography</i> in three volumes came
out in 1861, with copious extracts from the manuscripts preserved at
Wynyard. It was made the subject of an interesting essay in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> for January 1862, reprinted in <i>Essays by the late
Marquis of Salisbury</i> (London, 1905). A graceful sketch by Theresa,
Marchioness of Londonderry (London, 1904), originally brought
out in the <i>Anglo-Saxon Review</i>, contains some extracts from Castlereagh&rsquo;s
unpublished correspondence with his wife, the record of an
enduring and passionate attachment which throws a new light on
the man.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONDONDERRY,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> a northern county of Ireland in the province
of Ulster, bounded N. by the Atlantic, W. by Lough Foyle and
Donegal, E. by Antrim and Lough Neagh, and S. by Tyrone.
The area is 522,315 acres, or about 816 sq. m. The county
consists chiefly of river valleys surrounded by elevated table-lands
rising occasionally into mountains, while on the borders
of the sea-coast the surface is generally level. The principal
river is the Roe, which flows northward from the borders of
Tyrone into Lough Foyle below Newton-Limavady, and divides
the county into two unequal parts. Farther west the Faughan
also falls into Lough Foyle, and the river Foyle passes through
a small portion of the county near its north-western boundary.
In the south-east the Moyola falls into Lough Neagh, and the
Lower Bann from Lough Neagh forms for some distance its
eastern boundary with Antrim. The only lake in the county
is Lough Finn on the borders of Tyrone, but Lough Neagh forms
about 6 m. of its south-eastern boundary. The scenery of the
shores of Lough Foyle and the neighbouring coast is attractive,
and Castlerock, Downhill, Magilligan and Portstewart are
favourite seaside resorts. On the flat Magilligan peninsula,
which forms the eastern horn of Lough Foyle, the base-line
of the trigonometrical survey of Ireland was measured in 1826.
The scenery of the Roe valley, with the picturesque towns of
Limavady and Dungiven, is also <span class="correction" title="amended from atrractive">attractive</span>, and the roads from
the latter place to Draperstown and to Maghera, traversing the
passes of Evishgore and Glenshane respectively, afford fine views
of the Sperrin and Slieve Gallion mountains.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The west of this county consists of Dalradian mica-schist, with
some quartzite, and is a continuation of the northern region of
Tyrone. An inlier of these rocks appears in the rising ground east
of Dungiven, including dark grey crystalline limestone. Old Red
Sandstone and Lower Carboniferous Sandstone overlie these old
rocks in the south and east, meeting the igneous &ldquo;green rocks&rdquo; of
Tyrone, and the granite intrusive in them, at the north end of Slieve
Gallion. Triassic sandstone covers the lower slope of Slieve Gallion
on the south-east towards Moneymore, and rises above the Carboniferous
Sandstone from Dungiven northward. At Moneymore we
reach the western scarp of the white Limestone (Chalk) and the overlying
basalt of the great plateaus, which dip down eastward under
Lough Neagh. The basalt scarp, protecting chalk and patches of
Liassic and Rhaetic strata, rises to 1260 ft. in Benevenagh north of
Limavady, and repeats the finest features of the Antrim coast. A
raised shelf with post-glacial marine clays forms the flat land west
of Limavady. Haematite has been mined on the south flank of
Slieve Gallion.</p>

<p>The excessive rainfall and the cold and uncertain climate are unfavourable
for agriculture. Along the sea-coast there is a district of
red clay formed by the decomposition of sandstone, and near the
mouth of the Roe there is a tract of marl. Along the valleys the
soil is often fertile, and the elevated districts of the clay-slate region
afford pasture for sheep. The acreage of pasture-land does not
greatly exceed that of tillage. Oats, potatoes and turnips are chiefly
grown, with some flax; and cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are kept
in considerable numbers. The staple manufacture of the county is
linen. The manufacture of coarse earthenware is also carried on,
and there are large distilleries and breweries and some salt-works.
There are fisheries for salmon and eels on the Bann, for which
Coleraine is the headquarters. The deep-sea and coast fisheries are
valuable, and are centred at Moville in Co. Donegal. The city of
Londonderry is an important railway centre. The Northern Counties
(Midland) main line reaches it by way of Coleraine and the north
coast of the county, and the same railway serves the eastern part of
the county, with branches from Antrim to Magherafelt, and Magherafelt
to Cookstown (Co. Tyrone), to Draperstown and to Coleraine,
and from Limavady to Dungiven. The Great Northern railway
reaches Londonderry from the south, and the city is also the starting-point
of the County Donegal, and the Londonderry and Lough
Swilly railways.</p>

<p>The population decreases (152,009 in 1891; 144,404 in 1901) and
emigration is extensive, though both decrease and emigration are
well below the average of the Irish counties. Of the total, about
43% are Roman Catholics, and nearly 50% Presbyterians or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page973" id="page973"></a>973</span>
Protestant Episcopalians. Londonderry (pop. 38,892), Coleraine
(6958) and Limavady (2692) are the principal towns, while Magherafelt
and Moneymore are lesser market towns. The county
comprises six baronies. Assizes are held at Londonderry, and quarter
sessions at Coleraine, Londonderry and Magherafelt. The county is
represented in parliament by two members, for the north and
south divisions respectively. The Protestant and Roman Catholic
dioceses of Armagh, Derry and Down each include parts of the
county.</p>
</div>

<p>At an early period the county was inhabited by the O&rsquo;Cathans
or O&rsquo;Catrans, who were tributary to the O&rsquo;Neills. Towards the
close of the reign of Elizabeth the county was seized, with the
purpose of checking the power of the O&rsquo;Neills, when it received
the name of Coleraine, having that town for its capital. In
1609, after the confiscation of the estates of the O&rsquo;Neills, the
citizens of London obtained possession of the towns of Londonderry
and Coleraine and adjoining lands, 60 acres out of every
1000 being assigned for church lands. The common council
of London undertook to expend £20,000 on the reclamation of
the property, and elected a body of twenty-six for its management,
who in 1613 were incorporated as the Irish Society, and
retained possession of the towns of Londonderry and Coleraine,
the remainder of the property being divided among twelve of
the great livery companies. Their estates were sequestrated
by James I., and in 1637 the charter of the Irish Society was
cancelled. Cromwell restored the society to its former position,
and Charles II. at the Restoration granted it a new charter, and
confirmed the companies in their estates. In the insurrection
of 1641 Moneymore was seized by the Irish, and Magherafelt
and Bellaghy, then called Vintner&rsquo;s Town, burned, as well as
other towns and villages. There are several stone circles, and
a large number of artificial caves. The most ancient castle of
Irish origin is that of Carrickreagh; and of the castles erected by
the English those of Dungiven and Muff are in good preservation.
The abbey of Dungiven, founded in 1109, and standing on a
rock about 200 ft. above the river Roe, is a picturesque ruin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONDONDERRY,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Derry</span>, a city, county of a city, parliamentary
borough (returning one member) and the chief town of
Co. Londonderry, Ireland, 4 m. from the junction of the river Foyle
with Lough Foyle, and 95 m. N.N.W. of Belfast. Pop. (1901)
38,892. The city is situated on an eminence rising abruptly
from the west side of the river to a height of about 120 ft. The
eminence is surrounded by hills which reach, a few miles to the
north, an elevation of upwards of 1500 ft., and the river and
lough complete an admirable picture. The city is surrounded by
an ancient rampart about a mile in circumference, having seven
gates and several bastions, but buildings now extend beyond this
boundary. The summit of the hill, at the centre of the town,
is occupied by a quadrangular area from which the main streets
diverge. Some old houses with high pyramidal gables remain
but are much modernized. The Protestant cathedral of St
Columba, in Perpendicular style, was completed from the
design of Sir John Vanbrugh in 1633, at a cost of £4000 contributed
by the city of London, and was enlarged and restored
in 1887. The spire was added in 1778 and rebuilt in 1802. The
bishop&rsquo;s palace, erected in 1716, occupies the site of the abbey
founded by Columba. The abbot of this monastery, on being
made bishop, erected in 1164 Temple More or the &ldquo;Great
Church,&rdquo; one of the finest buildings in Ireland previous to the
Anglo-Norman invasion. The original abbey church was called
the &ldquo;Black Church,&rdquo; but both it and the &ldquo;Great Church&rdquo;
were demolished in 1600 and their materials used in fortifying
the city. There is a large Roman Catholic cathedral, erected
c. 1870 and dedicated to St Eugenius. For Foyle College,
founded in 1617, a new building was erected in 1814. This and
the Academical Institution, a foundation of 1868, were amalgamated
in 1896. Magee College, taking its name from its
foundress, Mrs Magee of Dublin, was instituted in 1857 as a
training-school for the Presbyterian ministry.</p>

<p>The staple manufacture of the town is linen (especially shirt-making),
and there are also shipbuilding yards, iron-foundries,
saw-mills, manure-works, distilleries, breweries and flour-mills.
The salmon fishery on the Foyle is valuable. The river affords
a commodious harbour, its greatest depth being 33 ft. at high
tide, and 12 ft. at low tide. It is under the jurisdiction of the
Irish Society. The port has a considerable shipping trade with
Great Britain, exporting agricultural produce and provisions.
Regular services of passenger steamers serve Londonderry from
Glasgow, Liverpool, Morecambe, Belfast and local coast stations.
In 1898 Londonderry was constituted one of the six county
boroughs which have separate county councils.</p>

<p>About 5 m. W. of the city, on a hill 803 ft. high, is a remarkable
fort, consisting of three concentric ramparts, and an interior
fortification of stone. It is named the Grianan of Aileach, and
was a residence of the O&rsquo;Neills, kings of Ulster. It was restored
in 1878.</p>

<p>Derry, the original name of Londonderry, is derived from
<i>Doire</i>, the &ldquo;place of oaks.&rdquo; It owes its origin to the monastery
founded by Columba about 546. With the bishopric which
arose in connexion with this foundation, that of Raphoe was
amalgamated in 1834. From the 9th to the 11th century the
town was frequently in the possession of the Danes, and was
often devastated, but they were finally driven from it by Murtagh
O&rsquo;Brien about the beginning of the 12th century. In 1311 it
was granted by Edward II. to Richard de Burgh. After the
Irish Society of London obtained possession of it, it was incorporated
in 1613 under the name of Londonderry. From this
year until the Union in 1800 two members were returned to the
Irish parliament. The fortifications, which were begun in 1600,
were completed in 1618. In 1688 Derry had become the chief
stronghold of the Protestants of the north. On the 7th of
December certain of the apprentices in the city practically put
themselves and it in a stage of siege by closing the gates, and on
the 19th of April 1689 the forces of James II. began in earnest
the famous siege of Derry. The rector of Donaghmore, George
Walker, who, with Major Baker, was chosen to govern Derry,
established fame for himself for his bravery and hopefulness
during this period of privation, and the historic answer of &ldquo;No
surrender,&rdquo; which became the watchword of the men of Derry,
was given to the proposals of the besiegers. The garrison was
at the last extremity when, on the 30th of July, ships broke
through the obstruction across the harbour and brought relief.
Walker and the siege are commemorated by a lofty column
(1828), bearing a statue of the governor, on the Royal Bastion,
from which the town standards defied the enemy; and the
anniversary of the relief is still observed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONG, GEORGE<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1800-1879), English classical scholar, was
born at Poulton, Lancashire, on the 4th of November 1800, and
educated at Macclesfield grammar-school and Trinity College,
Cambridge. He was Craven university scholar in 1821
(bracketed with Lord Macaulay and Henry Malden), wrangler
and senior chancellor&rsquo;s medallist in 1822 and became a fellow
of Trinity in 1823. In 1824 he was elected professor of ancient
languages in the new university of Virginia at Charlottesville,
U.S.A., but after four years returned to England as the first
Greek professor at the newly founded university of London.
In 1842 he succeeded T. H. Key as professor of Latin at University
College; in 1846-1849 he was reader in jurisprudence and
civil law in the Middle Temple, and finally (1849-1871) classical
lecturer at Brighton College. Subsequently he lived in retirement
at Portfield, Chichester, in receipt (from 1873) of a Civil
List pension of £100 a year obtained for him by Gladstone. He
was one of the founders (1830), and for twenty years an officer,
of the Royal Geographical Society; an active member of the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, for which he
edited the quarterly <i>Journal of Education</i> (1831-1835) as well
as many of its text-books; the editor (at first with Charles
Knight, afterwards alone) of the <i>Penny Cyclopaedia</i> and of
Knight&rsquo;s <i>Political Dictionary</i>; and a member of the Society for
Central Education instituted in London in 1837. He contributed
the Roman law articles to Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of Greek and
Roman Antiquities</i>, and wrote also for the companion dictionaries
of <i>Biography and Geography</i>. He is remembered, however,
mainly as the editor of the <i>Bibliotheca Classica</i> series&mdash;the first
serious attempt to produce scholarly editions of classical texts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page974" id="page974"></a>974</span>

<p><span class="bold">LONG BRANCH,<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> a city of Monmouth county, New Jersey,
U.S.A., on the easternmost or &ldquo;long&rdquo; branch of the Shrewsbury
river and on the Atlantic coast, about 30 m. S. of New York
City. Pop. (1890) 7231; (1900) 8872, of whom 1431 were foreign-born
and 987 were negroes; (1910 census) 13,298. It is served
by the Pennsylvania, the Central of New Jersey, the New York
&amp; Long Branch, and electric railways, and by steamboats to
New York. The carriage roads in the vicinity are unusually
good. Long Branch is one of the oldest American watering-places.
It is situated on a bluff which rises abruptly 20-35 ft.
above the beach, and along the front of which bulkheads and
jetties have been erected as a protection from the waves; along
or near the edge of the bluff, Ocean Avenue, 60 ft. wide and
about 5 m. long (from Seabright to Deal), commands delightful
views of the ocean. A &ldquo;bluff walk&rdquo; runs above the water
for 2 m. The city has one public park, Ocean Park (about
10 acres), and two privately owned parks, one of which is
Pleasure Bay Park (25 acres), on the Shrewsbury river, where
operas are given in the open air. The principal public institutions
are the Monmouth Memorial Hospital and the Long Branch
Circulating Library. In Long Branch the Monmouth County
Horse Show is held annually in July. The southern part of
Long Branch, known as Elberon, contains some beautiful
summer residences&mdash;in one of its cottages General U. S. Grant
spent his summers for many years, and in another, the
Francklyn, President J. A. Garfield died in 1881. In 1909 a
monument to Garfield was erected in Ocean Park. Adjoining
Long Branch on the N. is the borough of Monmouth Beach
(incorporated in 1906; population, 1910, 485). Before the
War of Independence the site of Long Branch was owned by
Colonel White, a British officer. It was confiscated as a result of
the war, and late in the century its development as a watering-place
began. Long Branch was chartered as a city in 1904.</p>

<p><i>LONGCHAMP, WILLIAM</i> (d. 1197), chancellor of England
and bishop of Ely, entered public life at the close of Henry
II.&rsquo;s reign as official to the king&rsquo;s son Geoffrey, for the archdeaconry
of Rouen. Henry II., who disliked him, called him
the &ldquo;son of two traitors.&rdquo; He soon deserted Geoffrey for
Richard, who made him chancellor of the duchy of Aquitaine.
He always showed himself an able diplomatist. He first distinguished
himself at Paris, as Richard&rsquo;s envoy, when he defeated
Henry II.&rsquo;s attempt to make peace with Philip Augustus (1189).
On Richard&rsquo;s accession William became chancellor of the kingdom
and bishop of Ely. When Richard left England (Dec.
1189), he put the tower of London in his hands and chose him
to share with Hugh de Puiset, the great bishop of Durham,
the office of chief justiciar. William immediately quarrelled
with Hugh, and by April 1190 had managed to oust him completely
from office. In June 1190 he received a commission as
legate from Pope Celestine. He was then master in church as
well as state. But his disagreeable appearance and manners,
his pride, his contempt for everything English made him detested.
His progresses through the country with a train of a
thousand knights were ruinous to those on whom devolved the
burden of entertaining him. Even John seemed preferable to
him. John returned to England in 1191; he and his adherents
were immediately involved in disputes with William, who was
always worsted. At last (June 1191) Geoffrey, archbishop of
York and William&rsquo;s earliest benefactor, was violently arrested
by William&rsquo;s subordinates on landing at Dover. They exceeded
their orders, which were to prevent the archbishop from entering
England until he had sworn fealty to Richard. But this outrage
was made a pretext for a general rising against William, whose
legatine commission had now expired, and whose power was
balanced by the presence of the archbishop of Rouen, Walter
Coutances, with a commission from the king, William shut
himself up in the Tower, but he was forced to surrender his
castles and expelled from the kingdom. In 1193 he joined
Richard in Germany, and Richard seems to have attributed
the settlement soon after concluded between himself and the
emperor, to his &ldquo;dearest chancellor.&rdquo; For the rest of the reign
Longchamp was employed in confidential and diplomatic missions
by Richard all over the continent, in Germany, in France
and at Rome. He died in January 1197. His loyalty to Richard
was unswerving, and it was no doubt through his unscrupulous
devotion to the royal interest that he incurred the hatred of
Richard&rsquo;s English subjects.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGCLOTH,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> a plain cotton cloth originally made in comparatively
long pieces. The name was applied particularly to cloth
made in India. Longcloth, which is now commonly bleached,
comprehends a number of various qualities. It is heavier than
cambric, and finer than medium or Mexican. As it is used
principally for underclothing and shirts, most of the longcloth
sold in Great Britain passes through the hands of the shirt and
underclothing manufacturers, who sell to the shopkeepers,
though there is still a considerable if decreasing retail trade in
piece-goods. The lower kinds of longcloth, which are made
from American cotton, correspond in quality to the better
kinds of &ldquo;shirting&rdquo; made for the East, but the best longcloths
are made from Egyptian cotton, and are fine and fairly costly
goods.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGEVITY,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> a term applied to express either the length or the
duration of life in any organism, but, as cases of long duration
excite most interest, frequently used to denote a relatively
unusual prolongation of life. There is no reason to suppose
that protoplasm, the living material of organisms, has a necessarily
limited duration of life, provided that the conditions
proper to it are maintained, and it has been argued that since
every living organism comes into existence as a piece of the protoplasm
of a pre-existing living organism, protoplasm is potentially
immortal. Living organisms exist, however, as particles or
communities of particles of protoplasm (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Life</a></span>), and as such
have a limited duration of life. Longevity, as E. Ray Lankester
pointed out in 1869, for practical purposes must be understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page975" id="page975"></a>975</span>
to mean the &ldquo;length of time during which life is exhibited in
an individual.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; must be taken in its
ordinary sense as a wholly or partially independent, organized
mass produced from a pre-existing organized mass, as otherwise
the problem will be confused by arguments as to the meaning of
biological individuality.</p>

<p><i>Empirical Data.</i>&mdash;A multitude of observations show that only
a very brief life, ranging from a few hours to a few days, is the
normal fate of the vast majority of single-celled organisms,
whether these be animal or vegetable or on the border-line
between the two kingdoms. Death comes to them rapidly from
internal or external causes, or the individual life ends in conjugation
or division or spore-formation. Under special conditions,
natural or artificial, the individual life may be prolonged by
desiccation, or freezing, or by some similar arrest of functional
activity.</p>

<p>The duration of life among plants is varied. The popular
division into annuals, biennials and perennials is not absolute,
for natural and artificial conditions readily prolong the lives of
annuals and biennials for several seasons, whereas the case of
perennials is much complicated by the mode of growth, and the
problem of individuality, however we desire to exclude it,
obtrudes itself. In the vast majority of cases where a plant is
obviously a simple individual, its life is short, ranging from a
few days in the case of fungi, to two seasons in the case of biennial
herbs. Most of the simple algae are annual, their life enduring
only for part of the year; the branching algae are more often
perennial, but in their cases not only are observations as to
duration lacking, but however simply we may use the term
individual, its application is difficult. The larger terrestrial
plants with woody tissues which we denote roughly as
shrubs and trees have an individuality which, although different
from that of a hyacinth or carrot, is usually obvious. Shrubs
live from four to ten or more years, and it apparently is the case
that odoriferous shrubs such as sage and lavender display the
longer duration. Trees with soft wood, such as poplars and
willows, last for about fifty years, fruit-trees rather longer.
Estimates of the age which large trees can attain, based partly
on attempts to count the annual rings, have been given by many
writers, and range from about three hundred years in the case
of the elm to three to five thousand years in the case of <i>Sequoia
gigantea</i> of California, and over five thousand years in that of the
baobab (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>) of Cape Verde. It is impossible to
place exact reliance on these estimates, but it is at least certain
that very many trees have a duration of life exceedingly great in
comparison with the longest-lived animals.</p>

<p>The duration of life amongst multicellular invertebrate
animals is little known, except in the frequent instances where
it is normally brief. Many sponges and polyps die at the end
of the season, leaving winter eggs or buds. The much-branched
masses of the larger sponges and compound hydrozoa certainly
may be perennial. A sea-anemone (<i>Actinia mesembryanthemum</i>),
captured in 1828 by Sir John Dalyell, a Scottish naturalist, and
then guessed to be about seven years old, lived in captivity in
Edinburgh until 1887, the cause of death being unknown. As
other instances of great ages attained by sea-anemones are on
record, it is plain that these animals, although simple polyps,
are long-lived. Echinoderms are inferred to live to considerable
ages, as they grow slowly and as there is great difference in size
amongst fully adult specimens. On similar reasoning, considerable
age is attributed to the larger annulates and crustacea,
but the smaller forms in many cases are known to have very
short lives. The variation in the length of life of molluscs
appears to be great. Many species of gastropods live only a
few years; others, such as <i>Natica heros</i>, have reached thirty years,
whilst the large <i>Tridacna gigas</i> is stated to live from sixty to a
hundred years. Among insects, the adult stage has usually
only a very short duration of life, extending from a few hours
to a few months, but the larval stages may last much longer.
Including these latter, the range of duration among insects, taking
the whole life from hatching to death, appears to lie between
the limits of a few weeks in the case of plant-lice to seventeen
years in the case of the American <i>Cicada septemdecim</i>, the larva
of which lives seventeen years, the adult only a month. Most
butterflies are annuals, but those which fail to copulate may
hibernate and live through a second season, whilst the lives of
some have been preserved artificially for seven years. Worker
bees and drones do not survive the season, but queens may live
from two to five years. In the case of vertebrates, the duration
of life appears to be greater among fish and reptiles than among
birds and mammals. The ancient Romans have noted that eels,
kept in aquaria, could reach the age of sixty years. Estimates
based on size and rate of growth have led to the inference that
salmon may live to the age of a hundred years, whilst G. L. L.
Buffon set down the period of life of carp in ponds as one hundred
and fifty years, and there is evidence for a pike having reached
the age of over two centuries. More recently it has been claimed
that the age of fish can be ascertained exactly by counting the
annual rings of the otoliths. No great ages have as yet been
recorded by this method, whilst, on the other hand, by revealing
great variations of weight and size in fishes with the same number
of annual rings, it has thrown doubt on the validity of estimates
of age based on size and rate of growth. The evidence as a whole
is unsatisfactory, but it is highly probable that in the absence
of accidents most fish can attain very great ages. The duration
of life among batrachia is little known, but small frogs have
been recorded as living over twelve years, and toads up to thirty-six
years.</p>

<p>Almost nothing is known as to the longevity of snakes and
lizards, but it is probable that no great ages are reached. Crocodiles,
alligators and caymans grow slowly and are believed to
live very long. There is exact evidence as to alligators in captivity
in Europe reaching forty years without signs of senescence,
and some of the sacred crocodiles of India are believed to be
more than a hundred years old. Chelonians live still longer. A
tortoise has lived for eighty years in the garden of the governor
of Cape Town, and is believed to be at least two hundred years
old. There are records of small land-tortoises that have been
kept in captivity for over a century, whilst the very large tortoises
of the Galapagos Islands certainly attain ages of at least two
centuries and possibly much more. A considerable body of
information exists regarding the longevity of birds, and much
of this has been brought together by J. H. Gurney. From his
lists, which include more than fifty species, it appears that the
duration is least in the case of small passerine and picarian
birds, where it ranges from eight or nine years (goat-suckers
and swifts) to a maximum of twenty-five years, the latter age
having been approached by larks, canaries and goldfinch. Gulls
have been recorded as living over forty years, ducks and geese
over fifty years (the duchess of Bedford has recorded the case of a
Chinese goose having been in possession of the same family for
fifty-seven years). Parrots frequently live over eighty years,
swans nearly as long, ravens and owls rather less, whilst there is
excellent evidence of eagles and falcons considerably exceeding
a hundred years. Notwithstanding their relatively large size,
struthious birds do not reach great ages. The records for cassowaries
and rheas do not exceed thirty years, and the maximum
for ostriches is fifty years, and that on doubtful evidence.</p>

<p>Exact records regarding the longevity of mammals are surprisingly
few. There is no evidence as to Monotremes. The life
of Marsupials in captivity is seldom long; a phalanger has lived
in the London Zoological Gardens and showed no signs of age
at more than ten years old; it may be inferred that the larger
forms are capable of living longer. Reliable records as to
Edentates do not exist; those in captivity have short lives, but
the size and structure of some of the extinct forms suggests that
they may have reached a great age. Nothing is known regarding
the longevity of Sirenians, except that they do not live long in
captivity. In the case of Cetaceans, estimates based on the
growth of whale-bone assign an age of several centuries to
whale-bone whales; exact records do not exist. More is known
regarding Ungulates, as many of these are domesticated, semi-domesticated
or are frequently kept in captivity. Great length
of life has been assigned to the rhinoceros, but the longest actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page976" id="page976"></a>976</span>
record is that of an Indian rhinoceros which lived for thirty-seven
years in the London Zoological Gardens. The usual
duration of life in the case of horses, asses and zebras is from
fifteen to thirty years, but instances of individuals reaching
fifty years are fairly well authenticated. Domestic cattle may
live from twenty-five to thirty years, sheep and goats from
twelve to fourteen years, antelopes rather longer, especially in
the case of the larger forms. A giraffe has lived for nineteen
years in the London Zoological Gardens. Deer are reputed to
live longer than sheep, and records of individuals at the London
Gardens confirm this, but it is doubtful if they live as long as
cattle. Camels are long-lived, according to repute, but actual
records show no great age; a llama which died in the London
Gardens at the age of seventeen years showed unmistakable
signs of senility. The hippopotamus is another large ungulate
to which great longevity has been assigned, but the longest
actual record is the case of a female born in the London Gardens
which died in its thirty-fifth year. The duration of life assigned
to domestic swine is about twenty years; an Indian wild boar,
alive in the London Zoological Gardens in 1910, and apparently
in full vigour, was fifteen years old. Elephants are usually
supposed capable of reaching great ages, but the actual records
of menagerie and military animals show that thirty to forty
years is a normal limit. Facts as to rodents are not numerous;
the larger forms such as hares and rabbits may live for ten years,
smaller forms such as rats and mice, for five or six years. Bats
have a reputation for long duration of life, and tropical fruit-bats
are known to have lived for seventeen years. No great ages
have been recorded for Carnivora, but the average is fairly high.
Twenty-five years appears to be a limit very rarely exceeded by
lions, tigers or bears; domestic cats may live for from twelve
to twenty-three years, and dogs from sixteen to eighteen years,
though cases of as many as thirty-four years have been noted.
Less is known of the smaller forms, but menagerie records show
that ages between twelve and twenty are frequently reached.
There were in 1910 in the London Zoological Gardens, apparently
in good health, a meerkat at least twelve years old, a sand-badger
fourteen years and a ratel nineteen years of age. Records
regarding monkeys are unsatisfactory, for these creatures are
notoriously delicate in captivity, and it is practically certain
that under such circumstances they rarely die of old age. A
grey lemur eleven years old and a chimpanzee eleven and a half,
both in good health in the London Zoological Gardens, appear
to be the oldest primates definitely recorded. Estimates based
on size, condition of the skull and so forth obtained by examination
of wild specimens that have been killed would seem to
establish a rough correspondence between the size of monkeys
and their duration of life, and to set the limits as between seven
or eight and thirty years.</p>

<p>With regard to the human race, there seems to be almost no
doubt but that the average duration of life has increased with
civilization; the generally improved conditions of life, the
greater care of the young and of the aged and the advance in
medical and surgical science far more than outweigh any depressing
effect caused by the more strenuous and nervous activity
required by modern social organization. The expectation of life
of those who attain the age of sixty varies with race, sex and
occupation, but is certainly increasing, and an increasing number
of persons have a chance of reaching and do reach ages between
ninety and one hundred. Careful investigation has thrown
doubt almost amounting to disproof on the much-quoted cases
of great longevity, such as that of Thomas Parr, the Shropshire
peasant, who was supposed to have reached his hundred and
fifty-third year, and, although the existence of centenarians
is thoroughly established, any ages exceeding a hundred by
more than two or three years are, at the most, dubious.</p>

<p>A survey of the facts of longevity, so far as these are established
on reasonable evidence, discloses that the recorded ages
both of men and animals are much shorter than those assigned
in popular belief. The duration of life is usually brief in the
animal kingdom, and except for some fish and reptiles, and
possibly whales, it is certain that a man enjoys the longest
average duration of life and that centenarians occur more
frequently amongst men than amongst most of the lower animals.</p>

<p><i>Theories of Longevity.</i>&mdash;Ray Lankester has pointed out that
several meanings are attached to the word longevity. It may
be used of an individual, and in this sense has little importance,
partly because of the inevitable variability of the individual,
and partly because there may be individuals that are abnormal
in duration of life, just as there are abnormalities in weight or
height. It may be used for the average duration of life of all the
individuals of a species and so be another way of expressing the
average mortality that affects the species, and that varies not
only with structure and constitution but with the kind of enemies,
accidents and conditions to which the members of the species are
subject. If we reflect on the large incidence of mortality from
external causes affecting a species and particularly the young
of a species, we shall see that we must conclude that intrinsic,
physiological causes can have relatively little weight in determining
the average mortality rate. Finally, longevity may be
used, and is most conveniently used, to denote the specific
potential longevity, that is to say the duration of life that would
be attained by normal individuals of a species if the conditions
were most favourable. It is necessary to keep in mind these
various applications of the term when considering the theoretical
explanations that have been associated with the empirical facts.</p>

<p>There is a certain relation between size and longevity. As a
general rule small animals do not live so long as larger creatures.
Whales survive elephants, elephants live longer than camels,
horses and deer, and these again than rabbits and mice. But
the relation is not absolute; parrots, ravens and geese live longer
than most mammals and than many larger birds. G. L. L.
Buffon tried to find a more definite measure of longevity, and
believed that it was given by the ratio between the whole period
of life and the period of growth. He believed that the possible
duration of life was six or seven times that of the period of
growth. Man, he said, takes fourteen years to grow, and his
duration of life is ninety to one hundred years; the horse has
reached its full size at four years of age and may live for a total
period of twenty-five to thirty years. M. J. P. Flourens
attempted to make Buffon&rsquo;s suggestion more exact; he took the
end of the period of growth as the time at which the epiphyses of
the long bones united with the bones themselves, and on this
basis held that the duration of life was five times the length of
the period of growth. The theories of Buffon and Flourens,
however, do not apply to all vertebrates and have no meaning in
the case of invertebrates. Y. Bunge has suggested that in the
case of mammals the period taken by the new-born young to
double in weight is an index of the rapidity of growth and is in a
definite relation to the possible duration of life. M. Oustalet
has discussed the existence of definite relations between duration
of life and size, rate of growth, period of gestation and so forth, and
found so many exceptions that no general conclusion could be
drawn. He finally suggested that diet was the chief factor in
determining the span of life. E. Metchnikoff has provided the
most recent and fullest criticism and theory of the physiological
causes of longevity. He admits that many factors must be
involved, as the results vary so much in different kinds of
animals. He thinks that too little is known of the physiological
processes of invertebrates to draw any valid conclusions in their
case. With regard to vertebrates, he calls attention to the
gradual reduction of longevity as the scale of life is ascended.
On the whole, reptiles live much longer than birds, and birds
than mammals, the contrast being specially notable when birds
and mammals are compared. He dismisses the effect of the
reproductive tax from possible causes of short duration of life,
for the obvious reason that longevity is nearly equal in the two
sexes, although females have a much greater reproductive drain.
He points out that the hind-gut or large intestine is least
developed in fishes, relatively small in reptiles, still small but
relatively larger in birds and largest in mammals, relatively and
absolutely, the caecum or caeca being reckoned as part of the
hind-gut. The area of the intestinal tract in question is of
relatively little importance in digestion, although a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page977" id="page977"></a>977</span>
amount of absorption may take place from it. It serves chiefly
as a reservoir of waste matter and is usually the seat of extensive
putrefactive change. The products of putrefaction are absorbed
by the blood and there results a constant auto-intoxication of
the body which Metchnikoff believes to be the principal agent in
senile degeneration. Mammals, if they escape from enemies,
diseases and accidents, fall victims to premature senility as the
result of the putrefactive changes in their intestines, and the
average mortality of the species is much too high, the normal
specific longevity being rarely if ever attained. Metchnikoff
urges, and so far probably is followed by all competent
authorities, that improvements in the conditions of life, greater
knowledge of disease and of hygiene and simplification of habits
are tending to reduce the average mortality of man and the
domestic animals, and to bring the average longevity nearer
the specific longevity. He adds to this, however, a more special
theory, which, although it appears rapidly to be gaining ground,
is yet far from being accepted. The theory is that duration of
life may be prolonged by measures directed against intestinal
putrefaction.</p>

<p>The process of putrefaction takes place in masses of badly-digested
food, and may be combated by careful dieting, avoidance
of rich foods of all kinds and particularly of flesh and alcohol.
Putrefaction, however, cannot take place except in the presence
of a particular group of bacteria, the entrance of which to the
body can be prevented to a certain extent. But it would be
impossible or impracticable to secure a sterilized diet, and
Metchnikoff urges that the bacteria of putrefaction can be
replaced or suppressed by another set of microbes. He found
that there was a widely spread popular belief in the advantage
of diet consisting largely of products of soured milk and that
there was a fair parallel between unusual longevity and such a
diet. Experimentally he showed that the presence of the bacilli
which produce lactic acid inhibited the process of putrefaction.
Accordingly he recommends that the diet of human beings
should include preparations of milk soured by cultures of selected
lactic acid bacilli, or that the spores of such bacilli should be
taken along with food favourable to their development. In a
short time the bacilli establish themselves in the large intestine
and rapidly stop putrefactive change. The treatment has not
yet been persisted in sufficiently long by a sufficient number
of different persons to be accepted as universally satisfactory,
and there is even more difference of opinion as to Metchnikoff&rsquo;s
theory that the chief agent in senile degeneration is the stimulation
of phagocytes by the products of putrefaction with the
resulting destruction of the specific cells of the tissues. Metchnikoff,
however, gave it to the world, not as a proved and completed
doctrine, but as the line of inquiry that he himself had
found most promising. He has suggested further that if the
normal specific longevity were attained by human beings, old
and not degenerate individuals would lose the instinct for
life and acquire an instinct for death, and that as they had
fulfilled the normal cycle of life, they would accept death with
the same relieved acquiescence that they now accept sleep.</p>

<p>The various writers whose opinions have been briefly discussed
agree in supposing that there is a normal specific longevity,
although Metchnikoff alone has urged that this differs markedly
from the average longevity, and has propounded a theory of the
causes of the divergence. It is common ground that they
believe the organism to be wound up, so to say, for a definite
period, but have no very definite theory as to how this period
is determined. A. Weismann, on the other hand, in a well-known
essay on the duration of life, has developed a theory to explain
the various fashions in which the gift of life is measured out to
different kinds of creatures. He accepts the position that purely
physiological conditions set a limit to the number of years that
can be attained by each kind of multicellular organism, but
holds that these conditions leave room for a considerable amount
of variation. Duration of life, in fact, according to Weismann,
is a character that can be influenced by the environment and
that by a process of natural selection can be adapted to the
conditions of existence of different species.</p>

<p>If a species is to maintain its existence or to increase, it is
obvious that its members must be able to replace the losses
caused by death. It is necessary, moreover, for the success
of the species, that an average population of full vigour should
be maintained. Weismann argues that death itself is an adaptation
to secure the removal of useless and worn-out individuals
and that it comes as soon as may be after the period of reproductive
activity. It is understood that the term reproductive
activity covers not merely the production of new individuals
but the care of these by the parents until they are self-sufficient.
The average longevity, according to Weismann, is adapted to
the needs of the species; it is sufficiently long to secure that the
requisite number of new individuals is produced and protected.
He has brought together a large number of instances which show
that there is a relation between duration of life and fertility.
Birds of prey, which breed slowly, usually producing an annual
brood of no more than one or two, live to great ages, whilst
rabbits which produce large litters at frequent intervals have
relatively short lives. Allowance has to be made in cases where
the young are largely preyed upon by enemies, for this counteracts
the effect of high fecundity. In short, the duration of life
is so adapted that a pair of individuals on the average succeed
in rearing a pair of offspring. Metchnikoff, however, has pointed
out that the longevity of such fecund creatures must have
arisen independently, as otherwise species subject to high risks
of this nature would have ceased to exist and would have
disappeared, as many species have vanished in the past of the
world&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>The normal specific longevity, the age to which all normal
individuals of a species would survive under the most favourable
conditions, must depend on constitution and structure. No
doubt selection is involved, as it is obvious that creatures would
perish if their constitution and structure were not such that they
could live long enough to reproduce their kind. The direct
explanation, however, must be sought for in size, complexity
of structure, length of period of growth, capacity to withstand
the wear and tear of life and such other intrinsic qualities.
The average specific longevity, on the other hand, depends on
a multitude of extrinsic conditions operating on the intrinsic
constitution; these extrinsic conditions are given by the
environment of the species as it affects the young and the adults,
enemies, diseases, abundance of food, climatic conditions and
so forth. It would seem most natural to suppose that in all
cases, except perhaps those of intelligent man and the domestic
animals or plants he harbours, the average longevity must
vary enormously with changing conditions, and must be a factor
of greater importance in the survival of the species than the
ideal normal specific longevity. It also seems more probable
that the reproductive capacity, which is extremely variable,
has been adapted to the average longevity of the species, than
that, as Weismann supposed, it should itself be the determining
cause of the duration of life.</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>The &ldquo;tranquil bay&rdquo; is Casco Bay, one of the most beautiful
in the world, studded with bold, green islands, well fitted to be
the Hesperides of a poet&rsquo;s boyish dreams. At the age of fifteen
Longfellow entered Bowdoin College at Brunswick, a town
situated near the romantic falls of the Androscoggin river, about
25 m. from Portland, and in a region full of Indian scenery and
legend. Here he had among his classfellows Nathaniel Hawthorne,
George B. Cheever and J. S. C. Abbott. During the
latter years of his college life he contributed to the <i>United States
Literary Gazette</i> some half-dozen poems, which are interesting
for two reasons&mdash;(1) as showing the poet&rsquo;s early, book-mediated
sympathy with nature and legendary heroisms, and (2) as being
almost entirely free from that supernatural view of nature
which his subsequent residence in Europe imparted to him.
He graduated in 1825, at the age of eighteen, with honours,
among others that of writing the &ldquo;class poem&rdquo;&mdash;taking the
fourth place in a class of thirty-eight. He then entered his
father&rsquo;s law office, without intending, however, it would appear,
to devote himself to the study of the law. For this profession
he was, both by capacity and tastes, utterly unfitted, and it was
fortunate that, shortly after his graduation, he received an offer
of a professorship of modern languages at Bowdoin College.
In order the better to qualify himself for this appointment,
he went to Europe (May 15th, 1826) and spent three years and
a half travelling in France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Holland and
England, learning languages, for which he had unusual talent,
and drinking in the spirit of the history and life of these countries.
The effect of Longfellow&rsquo;s visit was twofold. On the one hand,
it widened his sympathies, gave him confidence in himself
and supplied him with many poetical themes; on the other,
it traditionalized his mind, coloured for him the pure light of
nature and rendered him in some measure unfit to feel or express
the spirit of American nature and life. His sojourn in Europe
fell exactly in the time when, in England, the reaction against
the sentimental atheism of Shelley, the pagan sensitivity of Keats,
and the sublime, Satanic outcastness of Byron was at its height;
when, in the Catholic countries, the negative exaggerations of
the French Revolution were inducing a counter current of positive
faith, which threw men into the arms of a half-sentimental,
half-aesthetic medievalism; and when, in Germany, the aristocratic
paganism of Goethe was being swept aside by that tide
of dutiful, romantic patriotism which flooded the country, as
soon as it began to feel that it still existed after being run over
by Napoleon&rsquo;s war-chariot. He returned to America in 1829,
and remained six years at Bowdoin College (1829-1835), during
which he published various text-books for the study of modern
languages. In his twenty-fourth year (1831) he married Miss
Mary Story Potter, one of his &ldquo;early loves.&rdquo; In 1833 he made
a series of translations from the Spanish, with an essay on the
moral and devotional poetry of Spain, and these were incorporated
in 1835 in <i>Outre-mer: a Pilgrimage beyond the Sea</i>.</p>

<p>In 1835 Longfellow was chosen to succeed George Ticknor
as professor of modern languages and belles-lettres in Harvard.
On receiving this appointment, he paid a second visit of some
fifteen months to Europe, this time devoting special attention
to the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland. During this
visit he lost his wife, who died at Rotterdam, on the 29th of
November 1835.</p>

<p>On his return to America in December 1836, Longfellow
took up his residence in Cambridge, and began to lecture at
Harvard and to write. In his new home he found himself amid
surroundings entirely congenial to him. Its spaciousness and
free rural aspect, its old graveyards and towering elms, its
great university, its cultivated society and its vicinity to
humane, substantial, busy Boston, were all attractions for such
a man. In 1837-1838 several essays of Longfellow&rsquo;s appeared
in the <i>North American Review</i>, and in 1839 he published
<i>Hyperion: a Romance</i>, and his first volume of original poetry,
entitled <i>Voices of the Night</i>. <i>Hyperion</i>, a poetical account of
his travels, had, at the time of its publication, an immense
popularity, due mainly to its sentimental romanticism. At
present few persons beyond their teens would care to read it
through, so unnatural and stilted is its language, so thin its
material and so consciously mediated its sentiment. Nevertheless
it has a certain historical importance, for two reasons&mdash;(1)
because it marks that period in Longfellow&rsquo;s career when,
though he had left nature, he had not yet found art, and (2)
because it opened the sluices through which the flood of German
sentimental poetry flowed into the United States. The <i>Voices
of the Night</i> contains some of his best minor poems, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;The
Psalm of Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Footsteps of Angels.&rdquo; In 1842 Longfellow
published a small volume of <i>Ballads and other Poems</i>,
containing some of his most popular pieces, <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;The Skeleton
in Armour,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wreck of the Hesperus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Village Blacksmith,&rdquo;
&ldquo;To a Child,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bridge,&rdquo; &ldquo;Excelsior.&rdquo; In the
same year he paid a third brief visit to Europe, spending
the summer on the Rhine. During his return-passage across the
Atlantic he wrote his <i>Poems on Slavery</i> (1842), with a dedication
to Channing. These poems went far to wake in the youth of
New England a sense of the great national wrong, and to prepare
them for that bitter struggle in which it was wiped out at the
expense of the lives of so many of them. In 1843 he married
again, his wife being Miss Frances Elizabeth Appleton of Boston,
a daughter of Hon. Nathan Appleton, one of the founders of
Lowell, and a sister of Thomas G. Appleton, himself no mean
poet.</p>

<p>About the same time he bought, and fixed his residence in,
the Craigie House, where he had formerly only been a lodger,
an old &ldquo;revolutionary house,&rdquo; built about the beginning of the
18th century, and occupied by General Washington in 1776.
This quaint old wooden house, in the midst of a large garden
full of splendid elms, continued to be his chief residence till the
day of his death. Of the lectures on Dante which he delivered
about this time, James Russell Lowell says: &ldquo;These lectures,
illustrated by admirable translations, are remembered with
grateful pleasure by many who were thus led to learn the full
significance of the great Christian poet.&rdquo; Indeed, as a professor,
Longfellow was eminently successful. Shortly after the <i>Poems
on Slavery</i>, there appeared in 1843 a more ambitious work,
<i>The Spanish Student, a Play in Three Acts</i>, a kind of sentimental
&ldquo;Morality,&rdquo; without any special merit but good intention. If
published nowadays it would hardly attract notice; but in those
gushing, emotion-craving times it had considerable popularity,
and helped to increase the poet&rsquo;s now rapidly widening fame.
A huge collection of translations of foreign poetry edited by him,
and entitled <i>The Poets and Poetry of Europe</i>, appeared in 1845,
and, in 1846, a few minor poems&mdash;songs and sonnets&mdash;under
the title <i>The Belfry of Bruges</i>. In 1847 he published at Boston
the greatest of all his works, <i>Evangeline, a Tale of Acadie</i>. It
was, in some degree, an imitation of Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Hermann and
Dorothea</i>, and its plot, which was derived from Hawthorne&rsquo;s
<i>American Note-Books</i>, is even simpler than that of the German
poem, not to say much more touching. At the violent removal
by the British government of a colony of French settlers from
Acadie (Nova Scotia) in 1755, a young couple, on the very day
of their wedding, were separated and carried in different directions,
so that they lost all trace of each other. The poem describes
the wanderings of the bride in search of her lover, and
her final discovery of him as an old man on his death-bed, in a
public hospital which she had entered as a nurse. Slight as
the story is, it is worked out into one of the most affecting poems
in the language, and gives to literature one of its most perfect
types of womanhood and of &ldquo;affection that hopes and endures
and is patient.&rdquo; Though written in a metre deemed foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page979" id="page979"></a>979</span>
to English ears, the poem immediately attained a wide popularity,
which it has never lost, and secured to the dactylic hexameter
a recognized place among English metres.</p>

<p>In 1849 Longfellow published a novel of no great merit,
<i>Kavanagh</i>, and also a volume of poems entitled <i>The Seaside and
the Fireside</i>, a title which has reference to his two homes, the
seaside one on the charming peninsula of Nahant, the fireside
one in Cambridge. One of the poems in this collection, &ldquo;Resignation,&rdquo;
has taken a permanent place in literature; another,
&ldquo;Hymn for my Brother&rsquo;s Ordination,&rdquo; shows plainly the nature
of the poet&rsquo;s Christianity. His brother, the Rev. Samuel Longfellow,
was a minister of the Unitarian Church.</p>

<p>Longfellow&rsquo;s genius, in its choice of subjects, always oscillated
between America and Europe, between the colonial period
of American history and the Middle and Romantic Ages of
European feeling. When tired of the broad daylight of American
activity, he sought refuge and rest in the dim twilight of medieval
legend and German sentiment. In 1851 appeared <i>The Golden
Legend</i>, a long lyric drama based upon Hartmann von Aue&rsquo;s
beautiful story of self-sacrifice, <i>Der arme Heinrich</i>. Next to
<i>Evangeline</i>, this is at once the best and the most popular of
the poet&rsquo;s longer works, and contains many passages of great
beauty. Bringing his imagination back to America, he next
applied himself to the elaboration of an Indian legend. In 1854
he resigned his professorship. In the following year he gave
to the world the Indian Edda, <i>The Song of Hiawatha</i>, a conscious
imitation, both in subject and metre, of the Finnish epic, the
<i>Kalevala</i>, with which he had become acquainted during his
second visit to Europe. The metre is monotonous and easily
ridiculed, but it suits the subject, and the poem is very popular.
In 1858 appeared <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i>, based on
a charming incident in the early history of the Plymouth colony,
and, along with it, a number of minor poems, included under
the modest title, <i>Birds of Passage</i>. One of these is &ldquo;My Lost
Youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two events now occurred which served to cast a gloom over
the poet&rsquo;s life and to interrupt his activity,&mdash;the outbreak
of the Civil war, and the tragic fate of his wife, who, having accidentally
allowed her dress to catch fire, was burnt to death
in her own house in 1861. It was long before he recovered from
the shock caused by this terrible event, and in his subsequent
published poems he never ventured even to allude to it. When
he did in some measure find himself again, he gave to the world
his charming <i>Tales of a Wayside Inn</i> (1863), and in 1865 his
<i>Household Poems</i>. Among the latter is a poem entitled &ldquo;The
Children&rsquo;s Hour,&rdquo; which affords a glance into the home life of
the widowed poet, who had been left with five children&mdash;two
sons, Ernest and Charles, and three daughters,</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra,<br />
And Edith with golden hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small volume entitled <i>Flower de Luce</i> (1867) contains,
among other fine things, the beautiful &ldquo;threnos&rdquo; on the burial
of Hawthorne, and &ldquo;The Bells of Lynn.&rdquo; Once more the poet
sought refuge in medieval life by completing his translation
of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, parts of which he had rendered into
English as much as thirty years before. This work appeared
in 1867, and gave a great impulse to the study of Dante in
America. It is a masterpiece of literal translation. Next came
the <i>New England Tragedies</i> (1868) and <i>The Divine Tragedy</i>
(1871), which found no large public. In 1868-1869 the poet
visited Europe, and was everywhere received with the greatest
honour. In 1872 appeared <i>Three Books of Song</i>, containing
translated as well as original pieces, in 1873 <i>Aftermath</i> and in
1875 <i>The Mask of Pandora, and other Poems</i>. Among these
&ldquo;other poems&rdquo; were &ldquo;The Hanging of the Crane,&rdquo; &ldquo;Morituri
Salutamus&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Book of Sonnets.&rdquo; <i>The Mask of Pandora</i>
is a proof of that growing appreciation of pagan naturalism
which marked the poet&rsquo;s later years. Though not a great poem,
it is full of beautiful passages, many of which point to the riddle
of life as yet unsolved, a conviction which grew ever more and
more upon the poet, as the ebulliency of romanticism gave way
to the calm of classic feeling. In the &ldquo;Book of Sonnets&rdquo; are
some of the finest things he ever wrote, especially the five sonnets
entitled &ldquo;Three Friends of Mine.&rdquo; These &ldquo;three friends&rdquo;
were Cornelius Felton, Louis Agassiz and Charles Sumner, whom
he calls</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i6">&ldquo;The noble three,</p>
<p>Who half my life were more than friends to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">The loss of Agassiz was a blow from which he never entirely
recovered; and, when Sumner also left him, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed;</p>
<p class="i05">I stay a little longer, as one stays</p>
<p class="i05">To cover up the embers that still burn.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>He did stay a little longer; but the embers that still burnt
in him refused to be covered up. He would fain have ceased
writing, and used to say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great thing to know when
to stop&rdquo;; but he could not stop, and did not stop, till the last.
He continued to publish from time to time, in the magazines,
poems which showed a clearness of vision and a perfection of
workmanship such as he never had equalled at any period of
his life. Indeed it may be said that his finest poems were his
last. Of these a small collection appeared under the title of
<i>Keramos, and other Poems</i> (1878). Besides these, in the years
1875-1878 he edited a collection of <i>Poems of Places</i> in thirty-one
small volumes. In 1880 appeared <i>Ultima Thule</i>, meant to be
his last work, and it was nearly so. In October 1881 he wrote
a touching sonnet on the death of President Garfield, and in
January 1882, when the hand of death was already upon him,
his poem, <i>Hermes Trismegistus</i>, in which he gives utterance,
in language as rich as that of the early gods, to that strange
feeling of awe without fear, and hope without form, with which
every man of spotless life and upright intellect withdraws from
the phenomena of time to the realities of eternity.</p>

<p>In the last years of his life he suffered a great deal from
rheumatism, and was, as he sometimes cheerfully said, &ldquo;never
free from pain.&rdquo; Still he remained as sunny and genial as ever,
looking from his Cambridge study windows across the Brighton
meadows to the Brookline hills, or enjoying the &ldquo;free wild
winds of the Atlantic,&rdquo; and listening to &ldquo;The Bells of Lynn&rdquo;
in his Nahant home. He still continued to receive all visitors,
and to take occasional runs up to Castine and Portland, the
homes of his family. About the beginning of 1882, however, a
serious change took place in his condition. Dizziness and want
of strength confined him to his room for some time, and, although
after some weeks he partially recovered, his elasticity and powers
were gone. On the 19th of March he was seized with what
proved to be peritonitis, and he died on the 24th. The poet
was buried two days afterwards near his &ldquo;three friends&rdquo; in
Mount Auburn cemetery. The regret for his loss was universal;
for no modern man was ever better loved or better deserved
to be loved.</p>

<p>Longfellow was made an LL.D. of Bowdoin College in 1828,
at the age of twenty-one, of Harvard in 1859 and of Cambridge
(England) in 1868, and D.C.L. of Oxford in 1869. In 1873 he
was elected a member of the Russian Academy of Science, and
in 1877 of the Spanish Academy.</p>

<p>In person, Longfellow was rather below middle height, broad
shouldered and well built. His head and face were extremely
handsome, his forehead broad and high, his eyes full of clear,
warming fire, his nose straight and graceful, his chin and lips
rich and full of feeling as those of the Praxitelean Hermes, and
his voice low, melodious and full of tender cadences. His hair,
originally dark, became, in his later years, silvery white, and
its wavy locks combined with those of his flowing beard to give
him that leonine appearance so familiar through his later portraits.
Charles Kingsley said of Longfellow&rsquo;s face that it was
the most beautiful human face he had ever seen. A bust to his
memory was erected in the Poet&rsquo;s Corner in Westminster Abbey
in 1884.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In Longfellow, the poet was the flower and fruit of the man. His
nature was essentially poetic, and his life the greatest of his poems.
Those who knew only the poems he wrote could form but a faint
notion of the harmony, the sweetness, the manliness and the tenderness
of that which he lived. What he would have been as a poet, if,
instead of visiting Europe in early life and drinking in the spirit of the
middle ages under the shadows of cathedral towers, he had, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page980" id="page980"></a>980</span>
Whittier, grown old amid American scenery and life, we can only
guess from his earlier poems, which are as naturalistic, fresh and unmystical
as could be desired; but certain it is that, from his long
familiarity with the medieval view of nature, and its semi-pagan
offspring, the romantic view, he was brought, for the greater part of
his life, to look upon the world of men and things either as the middle
scene of a miracle play, with a heaven of rewarding happiness above
and a purgatory of purifying pain below, or else as a garment concealing,
while it revealed, spiritual forms of unfathomed mystery.
During this time he could hear &ldquo;the trailing garments of the night
sweep through her marble halls,&rdquo; and see &ldquo;the stars come out to
listen to the music of the seas.&rdquo; Later on, as he approached his
second youth (he was spared a second childhood), he tended to a more
pagan view. About the time when he was writing <i>The Mask of
Pandora</i>, he could see &ldquo;in the sunset Jason&rsquo;s fleece of gold,&rdquo; and hear
&ldquo;the waves of the distracted sea piteously calling and lamenting&rdquo;
his lost friend. But through all the periods of his life his view of the
world was essentially religious and subjective, and, consequently, his
manner of dealing with it hymnal or lyric. This fact, even more than
his merits as an artist, serves to account for his immense popularity.
Too well-informed, too appreciative and too modest to deem himself
the peer of the &ldquo;grand old masters,&rdquo; or one of &ldquo;those far stars
that come in sight once in a century,&rdquo; he made it his aim to write
something that should &ldquo;make a purer faith and manhood shine in the
untutored heart,&rdquo; and to do this in the way that should best reach
that heart. This aim determined at once his choice of subjects and
his mode of treating them.</p>

<p>The subjects of Longfellow&rsquo;s poetry are, for the most part, aspects
of nature as influencing human feeling, either directly or through
historical association, the tender or pathetic sides and incidents of
life, or heroic deeds preserved in legend or history. He had a special
fondness for records of human devotion and self-sacrifice, whether
they were monkish legends, Indian tales, Norse <i>drápas</i> or bits of
American history. His mode of treatment is subjective and lyric.
No matter what form his works assume, whether the epic, as in
Evangeline, <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i> and <i>Hiawatha</i>, the
dramatic, as in <i>The Spanish Student</i>, <i>The Golden Legend</i> and
<i>The Mask of Pandora</i>, or the didactic, as in <i>The Psalm of Life</i>
and many of the minor poems; they are all subjective. This is
not the highest praise that can be given to works of art; but it
implies less dispraise in Longfellow&rsquo;s case than in almost any other,
by reason of his noble subjectivity.</p>

<p>If we look in Longfellow&rsquo;s poetry for originality of thought, profound
psychological analysis or new insights into nature, we shall
be disappointed. Though very far from being hampered by any
dogmatic philosophical or religious system of the past, his mind,
until near the end, found sufficient satisfaction in the Christian view
of life to make it indifferent to the restless, inquiring spirit of the
present, and disinclined to play with any more recent solution of
life&rsquo;s problems. He had no sympathy with either scepticism or
formal dogmatism, and no need to hazard rash guesses respecting
man&rsquo;s destiny. He disliked the psychological school of art, believing
it to be essentially morbid and unhealthy. He had no sympathy
with the tendency represented by George Eliot, or with any attempt
to be analytic in art. He held art to be essentially synthetic, creative
and manifesting, not analytic, destructive or questioning. Hence
he never strove to draw from nature some new secret, or to show in
her relations never discovered before. His aim was to impress upon
her familiar facts and aspects the seal of his own gracious nature.
A man in intellect and courage, yet without conceit or bravado; a
woman in sensibility and tenderness, yet without shrinking or
weakness; a saint in purity of life and devotion of heart, yet without
asceticism or religiosity; a knight-errant in hatred of wrong and contempt
of baseness, yet without self-righteousness or cynicism; a
prince in dignity and courtesy, yet without formality or condescension;
a poet in thought and feeling, yet without jealousy or
affectation; a scholar in tastes and habits, yet without aloofness or
bookishness; a dutiful son, a loving husband, a judicious father, a
trusty friend, a useful citizen and an enthusiastic patriot,&mdash;he
united in his strong, transparent humanity almost every virtue under
heaven. A thoroughly healthy, well-balanced, harmonious nature,
accepting life as it came, with all its joys and sorrows, and living it
beautifully and hopefully, without canker and without uncharity.
No man ever lived more completely in the light than Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable traits in Longfellow&rsquo;s character
were his accessibility and his charity. Though a great worker, he
seemed always to have time for anything he was asked to do. He
was never too busy to see a caller, to answer a letter, or to assist,
by word or deed, any one that needed assistance. His courtesy to
all visitors, even to strangers and children who called to look at him,
or who, not venturing to call, hung about his garden-gate in order
to catch a glimpse of him, was almost a marvel. He always took
it for granted that they had come to see Washington&rsquo;s study, and,
accordingly, took the greatest interest in showing them that. He
never, as long as he could write, was known to refuse his autograph,
and so far was he from trying to protect himself from intruders that
he rarely drew the blinds of his study windows at night, though
that study was on the ground floor and faced the street. His acts
of charity, though performed in secret, were neither few nor small.
Of him it may be said with perfect truth, &ldquo;He went about doing
good&rdquo;; and not with his money merely, but also with his presence
and his encouragement. To how many sad hearts did he come like
an angel, with the rich tones of his voice waking harmonics of
hope, where before there had been despair and silence? How many
young literary people, disappointed at the unsuccess of their first
attempts, did he comfort and spur on to renewed and higher efforts!
How careful he was to quench no smoking flax! How utterly free
he was from jealousy or revengefulness! While poor, morbid Edgar
Allan Poe was writing violent and scurrilous articles upon him,
accusing him of plagiarism and other literary misdemeanours, he was
delivering enthusiastic lectures to his classes on Poe&rsquo;s poetry. His
charity was unbounded. Once, when the present writer proposed to
the president of the Harvard University Visiting Committee that
Longfellow should be placed on that committee, the president replied:
&ldquo;What would be the use? Longfellow could never be brought to
find fault with anybody or anything.&rdquo; And it was true. His whole
life was bathed in that sympathy, that love which suffers long and
envies not, which forgives unto seventy times seven times, and as
many more if need be. Even in his last years, when loss of friends
and continual physical pain made life somewhat &ldquo;cold, and dark and
dreary&rdquo; for him, he never complained, lamented or blamed the
arrangements of nature, and the only way in which it was possible to
know that he suffered was through his ever-increasing delight in the
health and strength of younger men. His whole nature was summed
up in the lines of his favourite poet:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGFORD,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> a county of Ireland in the province of Leinster,
bounded N.W. by Leitrim, N.E. by Cavan, E. and S. by Westmeath
and W. by Lough Ree and Roscommon. With the
exception of Carlow, Louth and Dublin, it is the smallest county
in Ireland, the area being 269,408 acres, or about 421 sq. m.
The general level surface is broken occasionally by low hills,
which cover a considerable area at its northern angle. The
principal rivers are the Camlin, which rises near Granard and
flows past Longford to the Shannon, and the Inny, which
entering the county from Westmeath crosses its southern corner
and falls into Lough Ree. Lough Ree is partly included in
Longford, and the other principal lakes are Lough Gowna,
Derrylough, Lough Drum and Lough Bannow.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Silurian axis of Newry reaches the north of this county, where
Lough Gowna lies upon it. The rest of the county, but for anticlinals
which bring up Old Red Sandstone at Longford town and
Ardagh, belongs to the Carboniferous Limestone plain, in which
Lough Ree forms a very characteristic lake, with signs of extension
by solution along its shores. Marble of fine quality has been raised.
In the north indications of iron are abundant, and there are also
some traces of lead.</p>

<p>The climate is somewhat moist and cold, and there is a large extent
of marsh and bog. The soil in the southern districts resting on the
limestone is a deep loam well adapted for pasture, but in the north
it is often poor. The proportion of tillage to pasture is roughly as
1 to 2. Oats and potatoes, in decreasing quantities, are the principal
crops. The numbers of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are well
maintained. The population is almost wholly rural, but the principal
industry of agriculture is supplemented by a slight manufacture of
coarse woollens and linen. The Midland Great Western line from
Mullingar to Sligo crosses the centre of the county by way of the
county town of Longford; and the Cavan branch touches the extreme
east. The Royal Canal enters the county in the south at
Abbeyshrule, and joins the Shannon near Cloondara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page981" id="page981"></a>981</span></p>

<p>The population (52,647 in 1891; 46,672 in 1901) decreases seriously,
owing to emigration. About 90% of the total are Roman Catholics.
The only towns of any importance are Longford (the county town,
pop. 3747) and Granard (1622). The county includes six baronies.
Assizes are held at Longford, and quarter sessions at Ballymahon,
Granard and Longford. The county is in the Protestant diocese of
Ardagh, and the Roman Catholic dioceses of Ardagh and Meath.
It is divided into two parliamentary divisions, north and south, each
returning one member.</p>
</div>

<p>The early name of Longford was Annaly or Analé, and it
was a principality of the O&rsquo;Farrels. Along with the province
of Meath, in which it was then included, it was granted by
Henry II. to Hugh de Lacy, who planted an English colony.
On the division of Meath into two counties in 1543, Annaly
was included in Westmeath, but under a statute of 1569, for
the shiring of countries not already shired, it was made shire
ground under the name of Longford.</p>

<p>Among antiquarian remains the chief ruin is the rath called
the Moat of Granard, at the end of the main street of that town.
There are monastic remains at Ardagh, a former bishopric,
Longford, Moydow and on several of the islands of Lough Ree.
The principal old castles are those of Rathcline near Lanesborough,
and Ballymahon on the Inny. The principal modern
seats are those of Carrickglass on the Camlin, and Castle Forbes,
the seat of the earls of Granard. Oliver Goldsmith was born
at Pallas, a village near Ballymahon, in this county; and at
Edgeworthstown the family of Edgeworth, of which the famous
novelist Maria Edgeworth was a member, established themselves
in the 16th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGFORD,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> the county town of Co. Longford, Ireland,
on the river Camlin, and on a branch of the Midland Great
Western railway, 75 m. W.N.W. of Dublin. Pop. (1901) 3747.
The principal building is St Mel&rsquo;s Roman Catholic cathedral
for the diocese of Ardagh, one of the finest Roman Catholic
churches in Ireland. The town has a considerable trade in grain,
butter and bacon. There are corn-mills, a spool factory and
tanneries. Longford is governed by an urban district council.
The ancient name of the town was Athfada, and here a monastery
is said to have been founded by St Idus, a disciple of St Patrick.
The town obtained a fair and market from James I. and a charter
of incorporation from Charles II., as well as the right to return
two members to parliament. It was disfranchised at the Union
in 1800.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGHI, PIETRO<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1702-1762), Venetian painter, was born in
Venice. He was a pupil of Antonio Palestra and Giuseppe
Maria Crespi at Bologna, and devoted himself to the painting
of the elegance of the social life in 18th-century Venice. The
republic was dying fast, but her sons, even in this period of
political decline, retained their love of pageants and ceremonies
and of extravagant splendour in attire. The art of Venice was
vanishing like her political power; and the only painters who
attempted to stem the tide of artistic decadence were the Canaletti,
Guardi, Tiepolo and Longhi. But whilst the Canaletti
and Guardi dwelt upon the architectural glories of Venice,
and Tiepolo applied himself to decorative schemes in which he
continued the tradition of Paolo Veronese and Tintoretto,
Longhi became the chronicler of the life of his compatriots.
In a way his art may be set beside Hogarth&rsquo;s, though the Venetian
did not play the part of a satirical moralist. He has aptly been
called the Goldoni of painting. His sphere is that of light social
comedy&mdash;the life at the café, the hairdresser&rsquo;s, at the dancing-school,
at the dressmaker&rsquo;s. The tragic, or even the serious,
note is hardly sounded in his work, which, in its colour, is generally
distinguished by a rich mellow quality of tone. Most of his
paintings are in the public and private collections of Venice.
They are generally on a small scale, but the staircase of the
Palazzo Grassi in Venice is decorated by him with seven frescoes,
representing scenes of fashionable life. At the Venice academy
are a number of his genre pictures and a portrait of the architect
Temanza; at the Palazzo Quirini-Stampalia the portrait of
Daniele Dolfino, &ldquo;The Seven Sacraments&rdquo; (etched by Pitteri),
a &ldquo;Temptation of St Anthony,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Circus,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Gambling
Scene,&rdquo; and several other genre pictures and portraits; at the
Museo Correr a dozen scenes of Venetian life and a portrait of
Goldoni. In England the National Gallery owns &ldquo;The Exhibition
of a Rhinoceros in an Arena,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Domestic Group,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Fortune-Teller,&rdquo; and the portrait of the Chevalier Andrea
Tron; two genre pictures are at Hampton Court Palace, and
others in the Richter and Mond collections. Many of his works
have been engraved by Alessandro Longhi, Bartolozzi, Cattini,
Faldoni and others. Longhi died in Venice in 1762.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LONGINUS, CASSIUS<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 213-273), Greek rhetorician and
philosophical critic, surnamed <span class="sc">Philologus</span>. The origin of his
gentile name Cassius is unknown; it can only be conjectured
that he adopted it from a Roman patron. He was perhaps a
native of Emesa (Homs) in Syria, the birthplace of his uncle
Fronto the rhetorician. He studied at Alexandria under Origen
the heathen, and taught for thirty years at Athens, one of his
pupils being the Neoplatonist Porphyry. Longinus did not
embrace the new speculations then being developed by Plotinus,
but continued a Platonist of the old type. He upheld, in opposition
to Plotinus, the doctrine that the Platonic ideas existed
outside the divine <span class="grk" title="Nous (hoti exô tou nou hyphestêke ta noêta">&#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7956;&#958;&#969; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#957;&#959;&#8166; &#8017;&#966;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#954;&#949; &#964;&#8048; &#957;&#959;&#951;&#964;&#940;</span>: see
F. Überweg, <i>Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie</i>, 9th ed.,
1903, i. § 72). Plotinus, after reading his treatise <span class="grk" title="Peri archôn">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8182;&#957;</span>
(<i>On First Principles</i>), remarked that Longinus might be a scholar
(<span class="grk" title="philologos">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>), but that he was no philosopher (<span class="grk" title="philosophos">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>). The
reputation which Longinus acquired by his learning was immense;
he is described by Porphyry as &ldquo;the first of critics,&rdquo;
and by Eunapius as &ldquo;a living library and a walking museum&rdquo;
or encyclopaedia. During a visit to the East he became teacher
in Greek, and subsequently chief counsellor in state affairs, to
Zenobia, queen of Palmyra. It was by his advice that she endeavoured
to regain her independence; Aurelian, however,
crushed the attempt, and while Zenobia was led captive to Rome
to grace Aurelian&rsquo;s triumph, Longinus paid the forfeit of his life.</p>

<p>Longinus was the author of a large number of works, nearly
all of which have perished. Among those mentioned by Suïdas
are <i>Quaestiones Homericae</i>, <i>An Homerus fuerit philosophus</i>,
<i>Problemata Homeri et solutiones</i>, <i>Atticorum vocabulorum editiones
duae</i>; the most important of his philological works, <span class="grk" title="philologoi
homiliai">&#934;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953; &#8001;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span> (<i>Philological Discourses</i>) consisting of at least 21 books,
is omitted. A considerable fragment of the <span class="grk" title="Peri telous">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> (<i>De
finibus, On the Chief End</i>) is preserved in the <i>Life of Plotinus</i>
by Porphyry (§ 20). Under his name there are also extant
Prolegomena to the <i>Encheiridion</i> of Hephaestion on metre
(printed in R. Westphal, <i>Scriptores Metrici Graeci</i>, i. 1866)
and the fragment of a treatise on rhetoric (L. Spengel, <i>Rhetores
Graeci</i>, i. pp. 299-320), inserted in the middle of a similar treatise
by Apsines. It gives brief practical hints on invention, arrangement,
style, memory and other things useful to the student.
Some important excerpts <span class="grk" title="ek tôn Logginou">&#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#923;&#959;&#947;&#947;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span> (Spengel, i. 325-328)
may possibly be from the <span class="grk" title="philologoi homiliai">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953; &#8001;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is as the reputed author of the well-known and remarkable work
<span class="grk" title="Peri hypsous">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8021;&#968;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> (generally, but inadequately, rendered <i>On the Sublime</i>)
that Longinus is best known. Modern scholars, however, with few
exceptions, are agreed that it cannot with any certainty be ascribed
to him, and that the question of authorship cannot be determined
(see Introduction to Roberts&rsquo;s edition). The following are the chief
arguments against Longinus. (1) The treatise is not mentioned by
any classical author, nor in any lists of the works attributed to him.
(2) The evidence of the MSS. shows that doubts existed even in early
times. In the most important (No. 2036 in the Paris Library, 10th
century) the heading is <span class="grk" title="Dionysiou ê Logginou">&#916;&#953;&#959;&#957;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7973; &#923;&#959;&#947;&#947;&#943;&#957;&#959;&#965;</span>, thus giving an alternative
author Dionysius; in the Laurentian MS. at Florence the title has
<span class="grk" title="anônymou">&#7936;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#973;&#956;&#959;&#965;</span>, implying that the author was unknown. The ascription
in the Paris MS. led to the addition of Dionysius to the name of the
reputed author&mdash;Dionysius Cassius Longinus, accounted for by the
supposition that his early name was Dionysius, Cassius Longinus
being subsequently adopted from a Roman patron whose client he
had been. (3) The absence of any reference to the famous writers on
rhetoric of the age of the Antonines, such as Hermogenes and
Alexander son of Numenius. (4) The opening sentences show that the
<span class="grk" title="Peri hypsous">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8021;&#968;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> was written with a view of correcting the faults of style and
method in a treatise by Caecilius (<i>q.v.</i>) of Calact&#275; on the same subject.
As Caecilius flourished during the reign of Augustus, it is hardly likely
that his work would have been selected for purposes of criticism in
the 3rd century. (5) General considerations of style and language
and of the point of view from which the work is written. In favour of
Longinus: (1) The traditional ascription, which held its ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page982" id="page982"></a>982</span>
unchallenged till the beginning of the 18th century. (2) The philosophical
colouring of the first chapter and the numerous quotations
from Plato are in accordance with what is known of his philosophical
opinions. (3) The treatise is the kind of work to be expected from
one who was styled &ldquo;the first of critics.&rdquo; (4) The Ammonius referred
to (xiii. 3) is supposed to be Ammonius Saccas (<i>c.</i> 175-242), but it
appears from the Venetian scholia to the <i>Iliad</i> that there was an
earlier Ammonius (fl. <i>c.</i> 140 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), a pupil and successor of Aristarchus
at Alexandria, who, judging from the context, is no doubt the writer
in question. The reference is therefore an argument against
Longinus.</p>

<p>The work is dedicated to a certain Terentianus, of whom nothing
is known (see Roberts&rsquo;s edition, p. 18).</p>

<p>The alternative author Dionysius of the MSS. has been variously
identified with the rhetorician and historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
the Atticist Aelius Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Dionysius
Atticus of Pergamum, Dionysius of Miletus. Other suggested
claimants to the authorship are Plutarch (L. Vaucher in <i>Études
critiques sur le traité du sublime</i> (Geneva, 1854) and Aelius Theon of
Alexandria (W. Christ), the author of a work on the <i>Arrangement of
Speech</i>. But it seems most probable that the author was an unknown
writer who flourished in the 1st century soon after Caecilius and before
Hermogenes. Wilamowitz-Möllendorff gives his date as about
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 40.</p>

<p>The rendering <i>On the Sublime</i> implies more than is intended by
the Greek <span class="grk" title="Peri hypsous">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8021;&#968;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;impressiveness in style,&rdquo; Jebb). Nothing
abnormal, such as is associated with the word &ldquo;sublime,&rdquo; is the
subject of discussion; it is rather a treatise on style. According to
the author&rsquo;s own definitions, &ldquo;Sublimity is a certain distinction and
excellence in expression,&rdquo; &ldquo;sublimity consists in elevation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;sublimity is the echo (or expression) of a great soul&rdquo; (see note in
Roberts).</p>

<p>The treatise is especially valuable for the numerous quotations
from classical authors, above all, for the preservation of the famous
fragment of Sappho, the ode to Anactoria, beginning</p>

<p class="center"><span class="grk" title="phainetai moi kênos isos theoisin">&#966;&#945;&#943;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#943; &#956;&#959;&#953; &#954;&#8134;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7988;&#963;&#959;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">imitated by Catullus (li.) <i>Ad Lesbiam</i>,</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Ille mi par esse deo videtur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its main object is to point out the essential elements of an impressive
style which, avoiding all tumidity, puerility, affectation and
bad taste, finds its inspiration in grandeur of thought and intensity
of feeling, and its expression in nobility of diction and in skilfully
ordered composition&rdquo; (Sandys).</p>

<p>A full bibliography of the subject will be found in the edition by
W. R. Roberts (Cambridge, 2nd ed., 1907), containing an Introduction,
Analysis, Translation and Appendices (textual, linguistic,
literary and bibliographical), to which may be added F. Marx,
<i>Wiener Studien</i>, xx. (1898), and F. Kaibel, <i>Hermes</i>, xxxiv. (1899),
who respectively advocate and reject the claims of Longinus to the
authorship; J. E. Sandys, <i>History of Classical Scholarship</i> (2nd ed.,
1906), pp. 288, 338, should also be consulted. The number of translations
in all the languages of Europe is large, including the famous
one by Boileau, which made the work a favourite text-book of the
bellelettristic critics of the 18th century. A text and translation
was published by A. O. Prickard (1907-1908).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONG ISLAND,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> an island, 118 m. long and 12 to 23 m. wide,
with its axis E.N.E. and W.S.W., roughly parallel with the S.
shore of Connecticut, U.S.A., from which it is separated by Long
Island Sound (115 m. long and 20-25 m. wide) and lying S.E.
of the mainland of New York state, of which it is a part, and
immediately E. of Manhattan Island. Area, 1682 sq. m. The
east end is divided into two narrow peninsulas (the northern
culminating in Orient Point about 25 m. long, the southern
ending in Montauk Point, the eastern extremity of the island,
about 40 m. long) by the three bays, Great Peconic, Little Peconic
(in which lies Shelter Island) and Gardiners (in which lies Gardiners
Island). The N. shore is broken in its western half by
the fjords of Flushing Bay, Little Neck Bay, Manhasset Bay,
Cold Spring Harbor; Huntington Bay (nearly landlocked),
Smithtown Bay and Port Jefferson Harbor, which also is nearly
landlocked. East of Port Jefferson the N. shore is comparatively
unbroken. The S. shore has two bays, Jamaica Bay with many
low islands and nearly cut off from the ocean by the narrow spur
of Rockaway Beach; and the ill-defined Great South Bay,
which is separated from the Atlantic by the narrow Long Beach,
Jones Beach and Oak Island Beach, and by the long peninsula
(35 or 40 m.), called Fire Island or Great South Beach. Still
farther E. and immediately S. of Great Peconic Bay is Shinnecock
Bay, about 10 m. long and cut off from the ocean by a narrow
beach.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The N. side of the island was largely built by deposits along the
front of the continental glacier, and its peculiar surface is due to such
deposits. At Astoria the dark gneiss bed rock is visible. The S.
half of the island is mostly built of a light sandy or loamy soil and is
low, except for the hills (140-195 ft.) of Montauk peninsula, which are
a part of the &ldquo;back-bone&rdquo; of the island elsewhere running through
the centre from E. to W. and reaching its highest point in its western
extremity, Oakley&rsquo;s High Hill (384 ft.) and Hempstead Harbor Hill,
W. of which are the flat and fertile Hempstead Plains. North of the
back-bone or central ridge the country is hilly with glacial drift and
many boulders along the coast and with soil stonier and more fertile
than that of the &ldquo;South Side.&rdquo; There is good clay at Whitestone and
at Lloyd&rsquo;s Point on the north side. This north shore is comparatively
well wooded; the middle of the island is covered with stunted oaks
and scrubby pines; the south side is a floral mean between the other
divisions. It is cut in its middle part by a few creeks and tidal rivers<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
flowing into the Great South Bay. Another &ldquo;river,&rdquo; the Peconic,
about 15 m. long, runs E. into Peconic Bay. On the north side there
are few waterways save Nissequoge river, partly tidal, which runs N.
into Smithtown Bay. Near the centre of the island is Lake Ronkonkoma,
which is well below the level of the surrounding country, and
whose deep cold waters with their unexplained ebb and flow are said
to have been so feared by the Indians that they would not fish there.
There are salt marshes (probably 100 sq. m. in all) on the shore of
the Sound and of the Great South Bay.</p>

<p>As regards its fauna Long Island is a meeting-place for equatorial
and arctic species of birds and fish; in winter it is visited occasionally
by the auk and in summer sometimes by the turkey buzzard.
James E. DeKay in his botanical and zoological survey (1842-1849)
of New York state estimated that on Long Island there were representatives
of two-thirds of the species of land birds of the United
States and seven-eighths of the water birds&mdash;probably an exaggerated
estimate for the time and certainly not true now. There is snipe and
duck shooting, especially on the shores of the Great South Bay;
there is good deer hunting, especially in Islip town; and there are
several private preserves, some stocked with English game birds,
within 50 m. of New York City. There are many excellent trout
streams and the island was known in aboriginal times for its fresh
and salt water fish. Indian names referring to fishing places are
discussed in Wm. W. Tooker&rsquo;s <i>Some Indian Fishing Stations upon
Long Island</i>. Long Island wampum was singularly good&mdash;the
Indian name, Seawanhacky (Seawanhaka, &amp;c.), of the island has been
interpreted to mean &ldquo;shell treasury&rdquo;&mdash;and black wampum was
made from the purple part of the shell of the quahaug. Soft clams
are dug on the north shore at low tide and hard clams are found
along the southern shore, where (at Islip) they were first successfully
canned; scallops and other small shell fish are taken, especially at
the E. end of the island. But the most important shell fishery is
that of oysters. The famous Blue Points grow in the Great South
Bay, particularly at Sayville and Bellport, where seed oysters planted
from Long Island Sound develop into the Blue Points with characteristics
of no other variety of oyster. Farther west, on the S. shore
are grown the well-known Rockaway oysters. The New York State
Fish Commission has a hatchery at Cold Spring Harbor on the N.
shore. The largest commercial fisheries are on the south side, in the
ocean off Fire Island Beach, where there are great &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; in
which captured fish are kept alive before shipment to market. Sag
Harbor and East Hampton on the E. end of the island were important
whaling ports in the 18th century and the first part of the
19th, and they and other fishing villages afterward did a large business
in the capture of menhaden (<i>Brevoortia tyrannus</i>), a small shad-like
fish, which, following the custom of the Indians, they manufactured
into fertilizer. At Glen Cove there are now great starch factories.</p>

<p>The west end of the island has been called New York&rsquo;s market
garden. On the Hempstead Plains and immediately E. of them
along the north shore great quantities of cabbage and cucumbers are
grown and manufactured into sauerkraut and pickles. There are
large cranberry fields near the village of Calverton, immediately
W. of Riverhead.</p>
</div>

<p>There are a few large farms on Long Island, mostly on the
north side, but it is becoming more and more a place of suburban
residence. This change is due in part to cool summer and warm
winter winds from the ocean, which makes the July mean temperature
68° to 70° F. at the east end and the south side, and 72°
on the north shore, as contrasted with 74° for the west end and
New York City. The range of temperature is said to be less than
in any other place in the United States with the exception of
Corpus Christi (Tex.), Eureka (California), Galveston (Texas),
and Key West (Florida). Even on the south shore the humidity
for August and September is less than that of any location on the
Atlantic coast, or Los Angeles and San Diego on the Pacific,
according to Dr Le Grand N. Denslow in a paper, &ldquo;The Climate
of Long Island&rdquo; (1901). Surf-bathing on the south shore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page983" id="page983"></a>983</span>
yachting and boating on the Sound, the Great South Bay and
the Ocean, and hunting and fishing are attractions. At Garden
City, Nassau (Glen Cove), Great River and Shinnecock Hills
are well-known golf links; there are several hunt clubs; and
at Southampton are some of the best turf tennis-courts in the
United States. Few parts of the island are summer resorts in
the ordinary use of the word; there are large hotels hardly
anywhere save on Coney Island, at Far Rockaway, on Long
Beach and on Shelter Island; and a large part of the summer
population lives in private mansions. Some Long Island
&ldquo;country places&rdquo; are huge estates with game and fish preserves
and luxurious &ldquo;châteaux.&rdquo; The roads are good. The course of
the Vanderbilt automobile races is along the roads of the Hempstead
Plains. Also on the Hempstead Plains are the Creedmoor
Rifle Range, where, in an Interstate Park, E. of Jamaica, annual
international rifle shooting tournaments for the championship
of America were held until 1909; Garden City, which was
founded by A. T. Stewart for the purpose of providing comfortable
homes at low cost to his employés and others, and where
are the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral of the Incarnation,
St Paul&rsquo;s School for Boys and St Mary&rsquo;s School for Girls; and,
near Hempstead, the grounds of the Meadowbrook (hunt and
polo) Club and those of the Farm Kennel Club. The only railway
is the Long Island Railroad (owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad)
with western termini on Manhattan and in Long Island
City and Brooklyn, whence lines meet at Jamaica, and thence
three principal lines branch, the north shore to Wading River,
the main line to Greenport, and the south side to Montauk.</p>

<p>Long Island is a part of New York State, its western third
forming Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City&mdash;these
boroughs were formed respectively from Kings county and
from the w. half of Queens county upon the erection of Greater
New York, what was formerly the E. half of Queens county
then became Nassau county (area 252 sq. m.; pop., in 1900,
55,448, in 1905, 69,477), whose county-seat is Mineola. The
eastern and the larger part of the island is the less thickly
settled Suffolk county with an area of 918 sq. m. and a population
in 1900 of 77,582 and in 1905 of 81,653. The county-seat
of Suffolk county is Riverhead, so named from its position at
the head of the Peconic river on the W. end of Great Peconic
Bay. The ten townships of Suffolk county are large governmental
units, showing, by their similarity to the towns of New
England, the relation of the early settlers to New England.
The largest in area is Brookhaven, which reaches all the way
across the island near its central part. The townships of Suffolk
county with their population in 1905 were: Huntington (10,236).
Babylon (7919), Smithtown (3325), Islip (13,721), Brookhaven
(16,050), Riverhead (4950), Shelter Island (1105), Easthampton
(4303), Southold (8989) and Southampton (11,024). The total
population of Long Island was 1,452,611 in 1900, and 1,718,056
in 1905 (state census), the population of the borough of Brooklyn
alone for these years being 1,166,582 and 1,358,686.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The principal Indian tribes on Long Island at the
time of the first settlement by the whites were the Montauk,
on the eastern end of the island, where they gave their name to
the &ldquo;point&rdquo; and where their last &ldquo;king,&rdquo; David Pharoah, died
in 1785; the Shinnecock, who, much admixed with negro blood,
now live on the reservation between Canoe Place and Shinnecock
Hills; the Manhasset, on what is now Shelter Island; the
Patchogue, near the present village of that name; the Massapequa,
between the Hempstead Plains and what is now Islip,
who were defeated and practically exterminated in 1653 by
John Underhill; the Canarsie, who lived near the present
Jamaica; and on the north side the Nessaquague or Nissequoge
(in the present town of Smithtown), and the Sealtocot who gave
their name to Setauket in Brookhaven town. The first pastor
of the church (Presbyterian-Congregational) at Easthampton,
Thomas James (<i>c.</i> 1620-1696), is supposed to have translated a
catechism and parts of the Bible into the dialect of the Montauk,
among whom Samson Occum had a school between 1755 and
1765.</p>

<p>The territory of Long Island was included in the grant of
1620 by James I. to the Plymouth Company and in 1635 was
conveyed to William Alexander, earl of Stirling. The conflicting
claims of English and Dutch were the subject of the treaty concluded
at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1650, by which the Dutch
were to hold everything west of Oyster Bay, the English everything
east&mdash;a provision which accomplished no agreement,
since Oyster Bay itself was the matter of contention, and English
settlers on what the Dutch called the west side of Oyster Bay
refused to remove. Long Island was included in the territory
assigned to the duke of York in 1663-1664, when the New
England towns on the island objected to separation from Connecticut.
On the recovery of New York by the Dutch in 1673 the
eastern towns refused to submit to the Dutch governor. In
1674 by the treaty of Westminster Long Island became a part
of the British colony of New York. The Dutch settlements were
more important ethnically than historically; on the west end
of the Island the Dutch Reformed Church is still strong and there
are many Dutch names; at West Sayville, on the &ldquo;south side,&rdquo;
about 50 m. from New York, in a settlement made about 1786
by Gustav Tukker, who did much to develop the oyster fisheries,
Holland Dutch was the common speech until the last quarter of
the 19th century. The &ldquo;Five Dutch Towns&rdquo; were: Nieuw
Amersfoord (after 1801 officially called Flatlands), on Jamaica
Bay, where the first settlement was made about 1623 and the
first grant in 1636; Midwout (later Vlackte-Bosch and Flatbush),
settled between 1645 and 1650 and having in 1654 the
first Dutch church; Nieuw Utrecht, settled soon after 1650 and
incorporated in 1660; Breuckelen (now Brooklyn), which was
settled a little before its organization as a town in 1646; and
Boswijck (Bushwick), first settled by Swedes and Norwegians
and incorporated in 1660. These five towns became one administrative
district in 1661.</p>

<p>Apparently the earliest English settlement was at Hempstead
in 1640 by colonists from Lynn, Massachusetts, who based their
claim on the patent (1621) of Nova Scotia to Lord Stirling, but
were almost immediately driven out by the Dutch. In 1643
another English settlement was made at Hempstead by men from
Stamford, Connecticut, who in 1644 secured a patent from
Governor Kieft of New Netherland. In 1645 Kieft granted land at
Gravesend to Lady Deborah Moody, who had settled there about
1643, when she had left Lynn and the Salem church because of
her anti-pedobaptist views. At Gravesend in 1664 Colonel
Richard Nicolls first landed the English troops which occupied
the island; and in 1693 it became one of its three ports of entry.
The Connecticut towns on Long Island were as follows: Southampton
was settled in 1640 by the Lynn men driven out of
Hempstead by the Dutch, and in 1644-1664 was in the Connecticut
jurisdiction. Southold (the &ldquo;South Hold of New Haven&rdquo;),
called from 1640 until 1644 by the Indian name Yennicock,
had a church in 1640, and a court based on the Levitical law,
which was abolished in 1643 upon the remonstrance of the
authorities of New Haven. The Southold settlers were from
Hingham, Norfolk and New Haven, and the colony joined New
Haven in 1648, in which year the colony of Forrett&rsquo;s (now Shelter)
Island also submitted to New Haven. Easthampton was
settled in 1648 from Lynn. Oyster Bay was also settled by Lynn
men in 1640 and contested by the Dutch and English. Newtown,
officially called Middleburgh, was settled in 1652, purchased
from the Indians in 1656, &ldquo;annexed to the other side of the
Sound&rdquo; in 1662, in the same year took the name of Hastings,
in 1706 was the scene of the arrest of the Presbyterian itinerants
Francis Mackemie and John Hampton, and in 1766 was the
site of the Methodist Episcopal Society at Middle Village, the
second oldest of that denomination in America. Huntington
was settled in 1653 from New Haven, Hempstead, Southold and
Southampton. Other early settlements were: Jamaica, about
1657; Brookhaven, first settled at Ashford (now Setauket) from
Boston in 1655, and Smithtown, patented in 1677 to Richard
Smith of Setauket, who was said to be a soldier of Cromwell,
and of whom there is a story that having bargained with the
Indians for as much land as a bull could cover in a day he rode
his trained bull in a great circuit about the land he coveted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page984" id="page984"></a>984</span>
was thereafter known as &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Smith. Almost all these
English settlements were made by Presbyterians and from
Jamaica east this was the prevailing denomination. During
the war of Independence the battle of Long Island (see below)
was fought within what is now the borough of Brooklyn.</p>

<p><i>Battle of Long Island, 1776.</i>&mdash;The interest of this battle lies
in the fact that it was the first engagement in the campaign of
1776 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">American War of Independence</a></span>) and was expected
in England to be decisive of the contest in the colonies. After
the evacuation of Boston (March 1776), Lord Howe moved
against New York City, which he thought would afford a better
base of operations for the future. The Americans undertook
its defence although recognizing the difficulties in the case, as
the bay and rivers adjoining would enable the British fleet to
co-operate effectively with the army. To protect his left flank
Washington was forced to throw a portion of his troops over to
the Long Island side of the East river; they fortified themselves
there on the site of the present Borough of Brooklyn. Lord Howe,
who had encamped on Staten Island at the entrance to the
harbour, determined to attack this isolated left wing, and on the
22nd of August landed at Gravesend Bay, Long Island, with
about 20,000 men. The Americans maintained strong outposts
in the wooded hills in advance of their fortified lines. On
the morning of the 27th Howe, after four days&rsquo; reconnaissance,
attacked these posts with three columns, the left and centre
delivering the holding attack, and the right and strongest
column turning the enemy&rsquo;s left by a détour. Howe himself,
accompanied by Generals (Sir H.) Clinton and Lord Cornwallis,
led the turning movement, which came upon the rear of the
enemy at the moment when they were engaged with the two
other columns. By noon the Americans had been driven back
into the Brooklyn lines in considerable confusion, and with the
loss of about half their number. This constituted the battle.
The completeness of the English victory was due to the neglect
of the Americans in guarding the left of their outposts. Howe
has been criticized for not immediately assaulting the American
works which he might have carried on the evening of the battle.
In view of the fact that he had only defeated a small portion of
the American forces, and that the works were of considerable
strength, he decided to make a formal siege, and Washington
took advantage of the delay in operations to retreat across the
river to New York on the night of the 29th. This successful
movement repaired to some extent the bad moral effect of the
defeat of the 27th in the American camp. In the engagement
of Long Island Washington lost about 1200 prisoners and 30
guns, and 400 killed and wounded; of the latter the British
lost nearly the same number.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONG ISLAND CITY,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> formerly a city of Queens county, New
York, U.S.A., and since the 1st of January 1898 the first ward
of the Borough of Queens, New York City. Pop. (1880) 17,129,
(1890) 30,506, (1900) 48,272, of whom 15,899 were foreign-born.
It has a river front, on East river and Long Island Sound, of
10 m., and is the eastern terminal and the headquarters of the
Long Island railway, having a large Y.M.C.A. building (the gift
of Mrs Russell Sage) for employees of this railway. Among
manufactures are chemicals, pottery, varnish, silk, &amp;c., and there
are oil-storage warehouses. Most of the borough offices of
Queens borough are in Long Island City, which was formerly
the county-seat of Queens county. The first settlement within
the limits of what subsequently became Long Island City was
made in 1640 by a Dutch blacksmith, Hendrick Harmensen,
who soon afterward was murdered by an Indian. Other settlers,
both Dutch and English, soon followed, and established detached
villages, which became known as Hunter&rsquo;s Point, Blissville,
Astoria, Ravenswood, Dutch Kills, Middleton and Steinway.
In 1853 this group of villages, by that time virtually one community,
was called Long Island City, and it was formally
incorporated under that name in 1870. In 1871-1872 the city
was laid out by a commission of which General W. B. Franklin
was president. Political convictions, economic considerations
and fear combined to make the residents in this region largely
loyalist in their attitude during the War of Independence.
From 1776 to 1783 British troops occupied Newtown, a village
to the S. E. In January 1776 the committee on the state of
New York in Congress reported a resolution that &ldquo;Whereas a
majority of the inhabitants of Queens county, in the colony of
New York, being incapable of resolving to live and die free
men,... all such persons as voted against sending deputies
to the present convention in New York ... be put out of
the protection of the United Colonies,&rdquo; &amp;c., an action which
led to the arrest and imprisonment of many of the accused
persons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGITUDE<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>longitudo</i>, &ldquo;length&rdquo;), the angle
which the terrestrial meridian from the pole through a point
on the earth&rsquo;s surface makes with some standard meridian,
commonly that of Greenwich. It is equal to the difference
between local time on the standard meridian, and at the place
defined, one hour of time corresponding to 15° difference of
longitude. Formerly each nation took its own capital or principal
observatory as the standard meridian from which longitudes
were measured. Another system had a meridian passing through
or near the island of Ferro, defined as 20° W. of Paris, as the
standard. While the system of counting from the capital of
the country is still used for local purposes, the tendency in recent
years is to use the meridian of Greenwich for nautical and
international purposes. France, however, uses the meridian
of the Paris observatory as its standard for all nautical and
astronomical purposes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Time</a></span>). In astronomy, the longitude
of a celestial body is the distance of its projection upon the
ecliptic from the vernal equinox, counted in the direction west
to east from 0° to 360°.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGLEY, CHARLES THOMAS<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1794-1868), archbishop of
Canterbury, was born at Rochester, and educated at Westminster
and Oxford. He was ordained in 1818, and was appointed
vicar of Cowley, Oxford, in 1823. In 1827 he received the
rectory of west Tytherley, Hampshire, and two years later he
was elected headmaster of Harrow. This office he held until
1836, when he was consecrated bishop of the new see of Ripon.
In 1856 he was translated to the see of Durham, and in 1860
he became archbishop of York. In 1862 he succeeded John Bird
Sumner as archbishop of Canterbury. Soon afterwards the
questions connected with the deposition of Bishop Colenso were
referred to him, but, while regarding Colenso&rsquo;s opinions as
heretical and his deposition as justifiable, he refused to pronounce
upon the legal difficulties of the case. The chief event of his
primacy was the meeting at Lambeth, in 1867, of the first
Pan-Anglican conference of British, colonial and foreign bishops
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lambeth Conferences</a></span>). His published works include
numerous sermons and addresses. He died on the 27th of

<p><span class="bold">LONGMANS,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> a firm of English publishers. The founder of the
firm, Thomas Longman (1) (1699-1755), born in 1699, was the
son of Ezekiel Longman (d. 1708), a gentleman of Bristol.
Thomas was apprenticed in 1716 to John Osborn, a London
bookseller. At the expiration of his apprenticeship he married
Osborn&rsquo;s daughter, and in August 1724 purchased the stock
and household goods of William Taylor, the first publisher of
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, for £2282 9s. 6d. Taylor&rsquo;s two shops were
known respectively as the Black Swan and the Ship, and occupied
the ground in Paternoster Row upon which the present publishing
house stands. Osborn, who afterwards entered into partnership
with his son-in-law, held one-sixth of the shares in Ephraim
Chambers&rsquo;s <i>Cyclopaedia of the Arts and Sciences</i>, and Thomas
Longman was one of the six booksellers who undertook the
responsibility of Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>. In 1754 Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page985" id="page985"></a>985</span>
Longman took his nephew into partnership, the title of the firm
becoming T. and T. Longman.</p>

<p>Upon the death of his uncle in 1755, Thomas Longman (2)
(1730-1797) became sole proprietor. He greatly extended the
colonial trade of the firm. He had three sons. Of these, Thomas
Norton Longman (3) (1771-1842) succeeded to the business.
In 1794 Owen Rees became a partner, and Thomas Brown, who
was for many years after 1811 a partner, entered the house as
an apprentice. Brown died in 1869 at the age of 92. In 1799
Longman purchased the copyright of Lindley Murray&rsquo;s <i>English
Grammar</i>, which had an annual sale of about 50,000 copies;
he also purchased, about 1800, the copyright, from Joseph
Cottle, of Bristol, of Southey&rsquo;s <i>Joan of Arc</i> and Wordsworth&rsquo;s
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. He published the works of Wordsworth,
Coleridge, Southey and Scott, and acted as London agent for
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, which was started in 1802. In 1804 two
more partners were admitted; and in 1824 the title of the firm
was changed to Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, Brown &amp; Green.
In 1814 arrangements were made with Thomas Moore for the
publication of <i>Lalla Rookh</i>, for which he received £3000; and
when Archibald Constable failed in 1826, Longmans became
the proprietors of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. They issued in 1829
Lardner&rsquo;s <i>Cabinet Encyclopaedia</i>, and in 1832 M&rsquo;Culloch&rsquo;s
<i>Commercial Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>Thomas Norton Longman (3) died on the 29th of August 1842,
leaving his two sons, Thomas (4) (1804-1879) and William
Longman (1813-1877), in control of the business in Paternoster
Row. Their first success was the publication of Macaulay&rsquo;s
<i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>, which was followed in 1849 by the issue
of the first two volumes of his <i>History of England</i>, which in a few
years had a sale of 40,000 copies. The two brothers were well
known for their literary talent; Thomas Longman edited a
beautifully illustrated edition of the New Testament, and William
Longman was the author of several important books, among them
a <i>History of the Three Cathedrals dedicated to St Paul</i> (1869)
and a work on the <i>History of the Life and Times of Edward III.</i>
(1873). In 1863 the firm took over the business of Mr J. W.
Parker, and with it <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, and the publication of
the works of John Stuart Mill and J. A. Froude; while in 1890
they incorporated with their own all the publications of the old
firm of Rivington, established in 1711. The family control of the
firm (now Longmans, Green &amp; Co.) was continued by Thomas
Norton Longman (5), son of Thomas Longman (4).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGOMONTANUS<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Longberg</span>), <span class="bold">CHRISTIAN SEVERIN</span>(1562-1647), Danish astronomer, was born at the village of
Longberg in Jutland, Denmark, on the 4th of October 1562.
The appellation Longomontanus was a Latinized form of the
name of his birthplace. His father, a poor labourer called
Sören, or Severin, died when he was eight years old. An uncle
thereupon took charge of him, and procured him instruction
at Lemvig; but after three years sent him back to his mother,
who needed his help in field-work. She agreed, however, to
permit him to study during the winter months with the clergyman
of the parish; and this arrangement subsisted until 1577,
when the illwill of some of his relatives and his own desire for
knowledge impelled him to run away to Viborg. There he
attended the grammar-school, defraying his expenses by manual
labour, and carried with him to Copenhagen in 1588 a high
reputation for learning and ability. Engaged by Tycho Brahe
in 1589 as his assistant in his great astronomical observatory of
Uraniborg, he rendered him invaluable services there during
eight years. He quitted the island of Hveen with his master,
but obtained his discharge at Copenhagen on the 1st of June
1597, for the purpose of studying at some German universities.
He rejoined Tycho at Prague in January 1600, and having
completed the Tychonic lunar theory, turned homeward again in
August. He visited Frauenburg, where Copernicus had made
his observations, took a master&rsquo;s degree at Rostock, and at Copenhagen
found a patron in Christian Friis, chancellor of Denmark,
who gave him employment in his household. Appointed in
1603 rector of the school of Viborg, he was elected two years later
to a professorship in the university of Copenhagen, and his
promotion to the chair of mathematics ensued in 1607. This
post he held till his death, on the 8th of October 1647.</p>

<p>Longomontanus, although an excellent astronomer, was not
an advanced thinker. He adhered to Tycho&rsquo;s erroneous views
about refraction, held comets to be messengers of evil and
imagined that he had squared the circle. He found that the circle
whose diameter is 43 has for its circumference the square root of
18252&mdash;which gives 3.14185... for the value of &pi;. John Pell
and others vainly endeavoured to convince him of his error.
He inaugurated, at Copenhagen in 1632, the erection of a stately
astronomical tower, but did not live to witness its completion.
Christian IV. of Denmark, to whom he dedicated his <i>Astronomia
Danica</i>, an exposition of the Tychonic system of the world,
conferred upon him the canonry of Lunden in Schleswig.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGSTREET, JAMES<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (1821-1904), American soldier,
lieutenant-general in the Confederate army, was born on the
8th of February 1821 in Edgefield district, South Carolina, and
graduated at West Point in 1842. He served in the Mexican
War, was severely wounded, and received two brevets for
gallantry. In 1861, having attained the rank of major, he resigned
when his state seceded, and became a brigadier-general
in the Confederate army. In this rank he fought at the first
battle of Bull Run, and subsequently at the head of a division
in the Peninsular campaign and the Seven Days. This division
subsequently became the nucleus of the I. corps, Army of
Northern Virginia, which was commanded throughout the war
by Longstreet. This corps took part in the battles of second
Bull Run and Antietam, and held the left of Lee&rsquo;s front at
Fredericksburg. Most of the corps was absent in North Carolina
when the battle of Chancellorsville took place, but Longstreet,
now a lieutenant-general, returned to Lee in time to take part in
the campaign of Gettysburg. At that battle he disapproved of
the attack because of the exceptionally strong position of the
Federals. He has been charged with tardiness in getting into
the action, but his delay was in part authorized by Lee to await
an absent brigade, and in part was the result of instructions to
conceal his movements, which caused circuitous marching.
The most conspicuous fighting in the battle was conducted by
Longstreet. In September 1863 he took his corps to the west
and bore a conspicuous part in the great battle of Chickamauga.
In November he commanded the unsuccessful expedition against
Knoxville. In 1864 he rejoined Lee&rsquo;s army in Virginia, and on
the 6th of May arrived upon the field of the Wilderness as the
Confederate right had been turned and routed. His attack
was a model of impetuosity and skill, and drove the enemy
back until their entire force upon that flank was in confusion.
At this critical moment, as Longstreet in person, at the head of
fresh troops, was pushing the attack in the forest, he was fired
upon by mistake by his own men and desperately wounded.
This mischance stayed the Confederate assault for two hours,
and enabled the enemy to provide effective means to meet it.
In October 1864 he resumed command of his corps, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page986" id="page986"></a>986</span>
retained until the surrender, although paralysed in his right
arm. During the period of Reconstruction Longstreet&rsquo;s attitude
towards the political problem, and the discussion of certain
military incidents, notably the responsibility for the Gettysburg
failure, brought the general into extreme unpopularity, and in
the course of a controversy, which lasted for many years, much
was said and written by both sides which could be condoned
only by irritation. His acceptance of a Federal office at New
Orleans brought him, in a riot, into armed conflict with his old
Confederate soldiers. His admiration for General Grant and his
loyalty to the Republican party accentuated the ill-feeling of
the Southern people. But in time his services in former days
were recalled, and he became once more &ldquo;General Lee&rsquo;s war-horse&rdquo;
to his old soldiers and the people of the South. He held
several civil offices, among them being that of minister to
Turkey under Grant and that of commissioner of Pacific
railways under Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt. In 1896 he
published <i>From Manassas to Appomattox</i>, and in his later years
he prepared an account of Gettysburg, which was published soon
after his death, with notes and reminiscences of his whole
military career. General Longstreet died at Gainesville, Georgia,
on the 2nd of January 1904.</p>

duke in 1505. The marriage of his brother Louis with Jeanne,
daughter and heiress of Philip, count of Baden-Hochberg-Sausenberg
(d. 1503), added considerable estates to the house of
Longueville. Henry, duc de Longueville (d. 1663), took an
important part in the Fronde, and for a long time held the royal
troops in check in Normandy. His wife, Anne Geneviève (see
below), was a leading figure in the political dissensions of the
time. The last of the family was Jean Louis, the Abbé d&rsquo;Orléans,
who died in 1694. The numismatist, Charles d&rsquo;Orléans-Rothelin
(1691-1744), belonged to a bastard branch of the family.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGUEVILLE, ANNE GENEVIÈVE,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> <span class="sc">Duchesse de</span> (1619-1679),
was the only daughter of Henri de Bourbon, Prince de
Condé, and his wife Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, and
the sister of Louis, the great Condé. She was born on the 28th
of August 1619, in the prison of Vincennes, into which her father
and mother had been thrown for opposition to Marshal D&rsquo;Ancre,
the favourite of Marie de&rsquo; Medici, who was then regent in the
minority of Louis XIII. She was educated with great strictness
in the convent of the Carmelites in the Rue St Jacques at Paris.
Her early years were clouded by the execution of the duc de
Montmorency, her mother&rsquo;s only brother, for intriguing against
Richelieu in 1631, and that of her mother&rsquo;s cousin the comte de
Montmorency-Boutteville for duelling in 1635; but her parents
made their peace with Richelieu, and being introduced into
society in 1635 she soon became one of the stars of the Hôtel
Rambouillet, at that time the centre of all that was learned,
witty and gay in France. In 1642 she was married to the duc
de Longueville, governor of Normandy, a widower twice her age.
The marriage was not happy. After Richelieu&rsquo;s death her father
became chief of the council of regency during the minority of
Louis XIV., her brother Louis won the great victory of Rocroy in
1643 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Condé</a></span>), and the duchess became of political importance.
In 1646 she accompanied her husband to Münster, where he was
sent by Mazarin as chief envoy, and where she charmed the
German diplomatists who were making the treaty of Westphalia,
and was addressed as the &ldquo;goddess of peace and concord.&rdquo; On
her return she fell in love with the duc de la Rochefoucauld, the
author of the <i>Maxims</i>, who made use of her love to obtain
influence over her brother, and thus win honours for himself.
She was the guiding spirit of the first Fronde, when she brought
over Armand, Prince de Conti, her second brother, and her
husband to the malcontents, but she failed to attract Condé
himself, whose loyalty to the court overthrew the first Fronde.
It was during the first Fronde that she lived at the Hôtel de
Ville and took the city of Paris as god-mother for the child born
to her there. The peace did not satisfy her, although La Rochefoucauld
won the titles he desired. The second Fronde was
largely her work, and in it she played the most prominent part in
attracting to the rebels first Condé and later Turenne. In the
last year of the war she was accompanied into Guienne by the
duc de Nemours, her intimacy with whom gave La Rochefoucauld
an excuse for abandoning her, and who himself immediately
returned to his old mistress the duchesse de Chevreuse.
Thus abandoned, and in disgrace at court, the duchess betook
herself to religion. She accompanied her husband to his government
at Rouen, and devoted herself to good works. She took for
her director M. Singlin, famous in the history of Port Royal.
She chiefly lived in Normandy till 1663, when her husband died,
and she came to Paris. There she became more and more
Jansenist in opinion, and her piety and the remembrance of her
influence during the disastrous days of the Fronde, and above all
the love her brother, the great Condé, bore her, made her conspicuous.
The king pardoned her and in every way showed
respect for her. She became the great protectress of the Jansenists;
it was in her house that Arnauld, Nicole and De Lane
were protected; and to her influence must be in great part
attributed the release of Lemaistre De Sacy from the Bastille, the
introduction of Pomponne into the ministry and of Arnauld to the
king. Her famous letters to the pope are part of the history of
<span class="sc">Port Royal</span> (<i>q.v.</i>), and as long as she lived the nuns of Port
Royal des Champs were left in safety. Her elder son resigned
his title and estates, and became a Jesuit under the name of the
Abbé d&rsquo;Orléans, while the younger, after leading a debauched
life, was killed leading the attack in the passage of the Rhine in
1673. As her health failed she hardly ever left the convent of
the Carmelites in which she had been educated. On her death
in 1679 she was buried with great splendour by her brother
Condé, and her heart, as she had directed, was sent to the nuns of
the Port Royal des Champs.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief authority for Madame de Longueville&rsquo;s life is a little
book in two volumes by Villefore the Jansenist, published in 1738.
Victor Cousin has devoted four volumes to her, which, though immensely
diffuse, give a vivid picture of her time. See also Sainte-Beuve,
<i>Portraits des femmes</i> (1840). Her connexion with Port Royal
should be studied in Arnauld&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>, and in the different histories
of that institution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGUS,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> Greek sophist and romancer, author of <i>Daphnis and
Chloë</i>. Nothing is known of his life, and all that can be said is
that he probably lived at the end of the 2nd or the beginning of the
3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> It has been suggested that the name Longus
is merely a misreading of the last word of the title <span class="grk" title="Lesbiakôn

the best MS. begins and ends with <span class="grk" title="logou">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#965;</span> (not <span class="grk" title="loggou">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#965;</span>) <span class="grk" title="poimenikôn">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957;</span>.
If his name was really Longus, he was probably a freedman of
some Roman family which bore it. Longus&rsquo;s style is rhetorical, his
shepherds and shepherdesses are wholly conventional, but he has
imparted human interest to a purely fanciful picture. As an
analysis of feeling, <i>Daphnis and Chloë</i> makes a nearer approach
to the modern novel than its chief rival among Greek erotic
romances, the <i>Aethiopica</i> of Heliodorus, which is remarkable
mainly for the ingenious succession of incidents. Daphnis and
Chloë, two children found by shepherds, grow up together,
nourishing a mutual love which neither suspects. The development
of this simple passion forms the chief interest, and there are
few incidents. Chloë is carried off by a pirate, and ultimately
regains her family. Rivals alarm the peace of mind of Daphnis;
but the two lovers are recognized by their parents, and return to
a happy married life in the country. <i>Daphnis and Chloë</i> was the
model of <i>La Sireine</i> of Honoré d&rsquo;Urfé, the <i>Diana enamorada</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page987" id="page987"></a>987</span>
Montemayor, the <i>Aminta of Tasso</i>, and <i>The Gentle Shepherd</i> of
Allan Ramsay. The celebrated <i>Paul et Virginie</i> is an echo of the
same story.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>See J. Dunlop&rsquo;s <i>History of Prose Fiction</i> (1888), and especially E.
Rohde, <i>Der griechische Roman</i> (1900). Longus found an incomparable
translator in Jacques Amyot, bishop of Auxerre, whose French
version, as revised by Paul Louis Courier, is better known than the
original. It appeared in 1559, thirty-nine years before the publication
of the Greek text at Florence by Columbani. The chief subsequent
editions are those by G. Jungermann (1605), J. B. de Villoison
(1778, the first standard text with commentary), A. Coraes (Coray)
(1802), P. L. Courier (1810, with a newly discovered passage), E.
Seiler (1835), R. Hercher (1858), N. Piccolos (Paris, 1866) and Kiefer
(Leipzig, 1904), W. D. Lowe (Cambridge, 1908). A. J. Pons&rsquo;s edition
(1878) of Courier&rsquo;s version contains an exhaustive bibliography.
There are English translations by G. Thorneley (1733, reprinted
1893), C. V. Le Grice (1803), R. Smith (in Bohn&rsquo;s <i>Classical Library</i>),
and the rare Elizabethan version by Angel Day from Amyot&rsquo;s translation
(ed. J. Jacobs in <i>Tudor Library</i>, 1890). The illustrated editions,
generally of Amyot&rsquo;s version, are numerous and some are beautiful,
Prudhon&rsquo;s designs being especially celebrated.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONGWY,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> a fortified town of north-eastern France in the
department of Meurthe-et-Moselle, 89 m. N.N.W of Nancy
by rail. Pop. (1906) 8523. Longwy is situated on a plateau
overlooking the Chiers, a right-bank affluent of the Meuse, near
the frontiers of Belgium and Luxemburg. It comprises an upper
and a lower town; the former, on a hill, 390 ft. above the Chiers
valley, commands the Luxemburg road, and is strengthened
by an enceinte and a few outlying fortifications. There is
garrison accommodation for 5000 men and 800 horses, but the
permanent garrison is small. The lower town is the industrial
centre. The 17th-century church has a lofty square tower,
the hôtel de ville dates from 1730, and there is a fine hospital.
Iron is extensively mined in the district, and supplies numerous
blast furnaces. Several iron and steel works are in operation, and
metal utensils, fire-proof ware and porcelain are manufactured.
Longwy (<i>Longus vicus</i>) came into the possession of the French
in 1678 and was at once fortified by Vauban. It was captured
by the Prussians in 1792, 1815 and 1871.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LÖNNROT, ELIAS<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1802-1884), Finnish philologist and
discoverer of the <i>Kalevala</i>, was born at Nyland in Finland on
the 9th of April 1802. He was an apothecary&rsquo;s assistant, but
entered the university of Åbo in 1822, and after taking his
successive degrees became a physician in 1832. But before
this, as early as 1827, he had begun to publish contributions
to the study of the ancient Finnish language, and to collect
the national ballads and folklore, a field which was at that
time uncultivated. In 1833 he settled as a doctor in the country
district of Kajana, and began to travel throughout Finland and
the adjoining Russian provinces in his leisure time, collecting
songs and legends. In this way he was able to put together
the great epic of Finland, the <i>Kalevala</i>, the first edition of which
he published in 1835; he continued to add to it, and in 1849
issued a larger and completer text. In 1840 Lönnrot issued his
important collection of the Kanteletar, or folk-songs of ancient
Finland, which he had taken down from oral tradition. The
<i>Proverbs of Finland</i> followed in 1842. In 1853, on the death
of Castrén, Lönnrot became professor of the Finnish language
and literature at the high school of Helsingfors; he retired from
this chair in 1862. He died on the 19th of March 1884.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LONSDALE, EARLS OF.<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> This English earldom is held by
the ancient family of Lowther, which traces its descent to Sir
Hugh Lowther, who flourished in the reign of Edward I. Sir
Hugh&rsquo;s descendant Sir Richard Lowther (1529-1607) received
Mary queen of Scots on her flight into England in 1568, and in
the two following years was concerned with his brother Gerard
in attempts to release her from captivity. He was sheriff of
Cumberland and lord warden of the west marches. A house
built by Gerard Lowther at Penrith is now the &ldquo;Two Lions
Inn.&rdquo; Sir Richard&rsquo;s eldest son, Sir Christopher Lowther (d.
1617), was the ancestor of the later Lowthers, and another son.
Sir Gerard Lowther (d. 1624), was judge of the common pleas
in Ireland.</p>

<p>One of Sir Christopher&rsquo;s descendants was Sir John Lowther,
Bart. (d. 1706), the founder of the trade of Whitehaven, and
another was John Lowther (1655-1700), who was created Viscount
Lonsdale in 1696. Before this creation John had succeeded
his grandfather, another Sir John Lowther (d. 1675), as a
baronet, and had been member of parliament for Westmorland
from 1675 to 1696. In 1688 he was serviceable in securing
Cumberland and Westmorland for William of Orange; in 1690
he was first lord of the treasury, and he was lord privy seal from
March 1699 until his death in July 1700. Lonsdale wrote:
<i>Memoirs of the Reign of James II.</i>, which were printed in 1808
and again in 1857. His family became extinct when his son
Henry, the 3rd viscount (1694-1751), died unmarried in March
1751.</p>

<p>James Lowther, 1st earl of Lonsdale (1736-1802), was a son
of Robert Lowther (d. 1745) of Maulds Meaburn, Westmorland,
who was for some time governor of Barbados, and was descended
from Sir Christopher Lowther; through his mother Catherine
Pennington, James was a great-grandson of the 1st viscount
Lonsdale. He inherited one of the family baronetcies in 1751,
and from three sources he obtained immense wealth, being the
heir of the 3rd viscount Lonsdale, of Sir James Lowther, Bart.
(d. 1755) of Whitehaven, and of Sir William Lowther, Bart.
(d. 1756). From 1757 to 1784 he was a member of parliament,
exercising enormous influence on elections in the north of England
and usually controlling nine seats in the House of Commons,
where his nominees were known as &ldquo;Sir James&rsquo;s ninepins.&rdquo;
He secured the election of William Pitt as member for his
borough of Appleby in 1781, and his dispute with the 3rd duke
of Portland over the possession of the socage manor of Carlisle
and the forest of Inglewood gave rise to lengthy proceedings,
both in parliament and in the law courts. In 1784 Lowther
was created earl of Lonsdale and in 1797 Viscount Lowther
with an extended remainder. The earl&rsquo;s enormous wealth
enabled him to gratify his political ambitions. Sir N. W.
Wraxall (<i>Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</i>, ed. H. B. Wheatley,
1884), who gives interesting glimpses of his life, speaks of his
&ldquo;prodigious property&rdquo; and quotes Junius, who called him
&ldquo;the little contemptible tyrant of the north.&rdquo; He was known
as the &ldquo;bad earl,&rdquo; and Horace Walpole and others speak slightingly
of him; he was, however, a benefactor to Whitehaven,
where he boasted he owned the &ldquo;land, fire and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He married Mary (1768-1824) daughter of George III.&rsquo;s
favourite, John Stuart, 3rd earl of Bute, but died childless on
the 24th of May 1802, when the earldom became extinct; but a
kinsman, Sir William Lowther, Bart. (1757-1844), of Swillington,
became 2nd viscount Lowther. This viscount, who was created
earl of Lonsdale in 1807, is chiefly famous as the friend of
Wordsworth and the builder of Lowther Castle, Penrith. His
son, William Lowther, 3rd earl of Lonsdale (1787-1872), held
several subordinate positions in various Tory ministries, and
was lord president of the council in 1852. He died unmarried,
and was succeeded by his nephew Henry (1818-1876), whose
son Hugh Cecil (b. 1857) succeeded his brother as 6th earl of
Lonsdale in 1882.</p>

<p>Other prominent members of the Lowther family are the Right
Hon. James William Lowther (b. 1855), who became speaker
of the House of Commons in 1905; Sir Gerard Augustus Lowther
(b. 1858), who became British ambassador at Constantinople in
1908; and the Right Hon. James Lowther (1840-1904), who
was a well-known Conservative member of parliament from 1865,
onwards, and chief secretary for Ireland from 1878 to 1880.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONSDALE, WILLIAM<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (1794-1871), English geologist and
palaeontologist, was born at Bath on the 9th of September
1794. He was educated for the army and in 1810 obtained a
commission as ensign in the 4th (King&rsquo;s Own) regiment. He
served in the Peninsular War at the battles of Salamanca and
Waterloo, for both of which he received medals; and he retired
as lieutenant. Residing afterwards for some years at Batheaston
he collected a series of rocks and fossils which he presented to
the Literary and Scientific Institution of Bath. He became
the first honorary curator of the natural history department
of the museum, and worked until 1829 when he was appointed
assistant secretary and curator of the Geological Society of London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page988" id="page988"></a>988</span>
at Somerset House. There he held office until 1842, when ill-health
led him to resign. The ability with which he edited the
publications of the society and advised the council &ldquo;on every
obscure and difficult point&rdquo; was commented on by Murchison in
his presidential address (1843). In 1829 Lonsdale read before
the society an important paper &ldquo;On the Oolitic District of Bath&rdquo;
(<i>Trans. Geol. Soc.</i> ser. 2, vol. iii.), the results of a survey begun
in 1827; later he was engaged in a survey of the Oolitic strata
of Gloucestershire (1832), at the instigation of the Geological
Society, and he laid down on the one-inch ordnance maps the
boundaries of the various geological formations. He gave
particular attention to the study of corals, becoming the highest
authority in England on the subject, and he described fossil
forms from the Tertiary and Cretaceous strata of North America
and from the older strata of Britain and Russia. In 1837 he
suggested from a study of the fossils of the South Devon limestones
that they would prove to be of an age intermediate between
the Carboniferous and Silurian systems. This suggestion was
adopted by Sedgwick and Murchison in 1839, and may be
regarded as the basis on which they founded the Devonian
system. Lonsdale&rsquo;s paper, &ldquo;Notes on the Age of the Limestones
of South Devonshire&rdquo; (read 1840), was published in the same
volume of the <i>Transactions of the Geological Society</i> (ser. 2, vol.
v.) with Sedgwick and Murchison&rsquo;s famous paper &ldquo;On the
Physical Structure of Devonshire,&rdquo; and these authors observe
that &ldquo;the conclusion arrived at by Mr Lonsdale, we now apply
without reserve both to the five groups of our North Devon
section, and to the fossiliferous slates of Cornwall.&rdquo; The later
years of Lonsdale&rsquo;s life were spent in retirement, and he died
at Bristol on the 11th of November 1871.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LONS-LE-SAUNIER,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> a town of eastern France, capital of the
department of Jura, 76 m. N.N.E. of Lyons on the Paris-Lyons
railway, on which it is a junction for Chalon-sur-Saône, Dôle,
Besançon and Champagnole. Pop. (1906) 10,648. The town
is built on both sides of the river Vallière and is surrounded by
the vine-clad hills of the western Jura. It owes its name to the
salt mines of Montmorot, its western suburb, which have been
used from a very remote period. The church of St Désiré, a
building of the 12th and 15th centuries, preserves a huge
Romanesque crypt. The town is the seat of a prefects and of a
court of assizes, and there are tribunals of first instance and of
commerce, a chamber of commerce, lycées and training-colleges
for both sexes, and a branch of the Bank of France. There is
an establishment for the use of the mineral waters, which are
sodio-chlorinated and have strengthening properties. The
principal industry of the place is the manufacture of sparkling
wines, the Étoile growth being the best for this purpose. Trade
is in cheese, cereals, horses, cattle, wood, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Lons-le-Saunier, known as <i>Ledo</i> in the time of the Gauls, was
fortified by the Romans, who added the surname <i>Salinarius</i>
to the Gallic name. An object of contention owing to the value
of its salt, it belonged for a long time during the medieval period
to the powerful house of Chalon, a younger branch of that of
Burgundy. It was burned in 1364 by the English, and again in
1637, when it was seized by the duke of Longueville for Louis
XIII. It became definitively French in 1674. It was here that
the meeting between Ney and Napoleon took place, on the
return of the latter from Elba in 1815. Rouget de l&rsquo;Isle, the
author of the <i>Marseillaise</i>, was born at Montaigu near this town,
where there is a statue erected to him.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">LOO<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (formerly called &ldquo;Lanterloo,&rdquo; Fr. <i>lanturlu</i>, the refrain of
a popular 17th-century song), a round game of cards, played
by any number of persons; from five to seven makes the
best game. &ldquo;Three-card loo&rdquo; is the game usually played. An
ordinary pack of fifty-two cards is used and the deal passes
after each round. Each player must have the same number of
deals; but if there is a &ldquo;loo&rdquo; (the sum forfeited by a player
who plays, but does not win a trick) in the last deal of a round,
the game continues till there is a hand without a loo. The
dealer deals three cards face downwards, one by one, to each
player and an extra hand called &ldquo;miss,&rdquo; and turns up the top
of the undealt cards for trumps. Each player contributes to
the pool a sum previously agreed upon. The unit for a single
stake should be divisible by three without a remainder, <i>e.g.</i>
three counters or three pence. The players are bound to put in
the stake before the deal is completed. Each player in rotation,
beginning from the dealer&rsquo;s left, looks at his cards, and declares
whether he will play, or pass, or take &ldquo;miss.&rdquo; If the former,
he says &ldquo;I play.&rdquo; If he takes miss he places his cards face
downwards in the middle of the table, and takes up the extra
hand. If he passes, he similarly places his cards face downwards
in the middle of the table. If miss is taken, the subsequent
players only have the option of playing or passing. A player
who takes miss must play. Those who are now left in play
one card each in rotation, beginning from the dealer&rsquo;s left, the
cards thus played constituting a trick. The trick is won by
the highest card of the suit led, or, if trumped, by the highest
trump, the cards ranking as at whist. The winner of the trick
leads to the next, and so on, until the hand is played out. The
cards remain face upwards in front of the persons placing them.</p>

<p>If the leader holds ace of trumps he must lead it (or king, if
ace is turned up). If the leader has two trumps he must lead
one of them, and if one is ace (or king, ace being turned up)
he must lead it. With this exception the leader is not bound to
lead his highest trump if more than two declare to play; <i>but if
there are only two declared players</i> the leader with more than one
trump must lead the highest. Except with trumps as above
stated he may lead any card he chooses. The subsequent
players must head the trick if able, and must follow suit if able.
Holding none of the suit led, they must head the trick with a
trump, if able. Otherwise they may play any card they please.
The winner of the first trick is subject to the rules already
stated respecting the lead, and in addition he must lead a trump
if able (called <i>trump after trick</i>).</p>

<p>When the hand has been played out, the winners of the tricks
divide the pool, each receiving one-third of the amount for each
trick. If only one has declared to play, the dealer plays miss
either for himself or for the pool. If he plays for the pool he
must declare before seeing miss that he does not play for himself.
Any tricks he may win, when playing for the pool, remain there
as an addition to the next pool. Other rules provide that the
dealer must play, if only one player stands, with his own cards
or with &ldquo;miss.&rdquo; If miss is gone and against him, he may defend
with the three top cards of the pack, excluding the trump card;
these cards are called &ldquo;master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If each declared player wins at least one trick it is a <i>single</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> a fresh pool is made as already described; but if one of the
declared players fails to make a trick he is looed. Then only
the player who is looed contributes to the next pool. If more
than one player is looed, each has to contribute.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>At <i>unlimited loo</i> each player looed has to put in the amount there
was in the pool. But it is often agreed to limit the loo, so that it
shall not exceed a certain fixed sum. Thus, at eighteen-penny loo,
the loo is generally limited to half a guinea. If there is less than the
limit in the pool the payment is regulated as before; but if there is
more than the limit, the loo is the fixed sum agreed on.</p>

<p>The game is sometimes varied by &ldquo;forces,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> by compelling
every one to play in the first deal, or when there is no loo the previous
deal, or whenever clubs are trumps (&ldquo;club law&rdquo;). When there is
a force no miss is dealt. &ldquo;Irish loo&rdquo; is played by allowing declared
players to exchange some or all of their cards for cards dealt from the
top of the pack. There is no miss, and it is not compulsory to lead
a trump with two trumps, unless there are only two declared players.
At &ldquo;five-card loo&rdquo; each player has five cards instead of three, and a
single stake should be divisible by five. &ldquo;Pam&rdquo; (knave of clubs)
ranks as the highest trump, whatever suit is turned up. There is no
miss, and cards may be exchanged as at Irish loo. If ace of trumps
is led, the leader says &ldquo;Pam be civil,&rdquo; when the holder of that card
must pass the trick if he can do so without revoking. A flush (five
cards of the same suit, or four with Pam) &ldquo;loos the board,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the
holder receives the amount of a loo from every one, and the hand is
not played. A trump flush takes precedence of flushes in other suits.
If more than one flush is held, or if Pam is held, the holder is exempted
from payment. As between two flushes which do not take
precedence, the elder hand wins. A single stake should be divisible
by five.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOOE,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> a seaport and market town in the Bodmin parliamentary
division of Cornwall, England, 17 m. by sea W. of
Plymouth, a terminus of the Liskeard &amp; Looe light railway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page989" id="page989"></a>989</span>
Pop. (1901) 2548. It is divided by the river into East Looe and
West Looe; and is sheltered so completely by the surrounding
hills that myrtles, geraniums, fuchsias and other delicate plants
flourish at all seasons in the open air. Its lanes are narrow,
steep and winding; many of the houses are entered by wooden
staircases; and though considerably modernized the town has
a medieval air. Inland, the shores of the river are richly wooded;
and towards the sea they rise on the south into rugged cliffs.
The parish church of St Martin, which stands 1 m. outside the
town, has a Norman doorway and font. Among other buildings
may be mentioned the ancient chapel of St Nicholas in West
Looe, restored in 1862; and the old town-hall, where the ancient
pillory is preserved. A considerable export trade in copper, tin
and granite was formerly carried on, and the last is still exported,
but the chief trade is in grain; while timber, coal and limestone
are imported. There are also thriving fisheries, the Looe fishermen
being particularly expert with the seine on a rocky bottom.
The inlet of Trelawne is one of the most exquisite wooded coombes
in Cornwall. At its head are the remains of a camp, connected
with the Giant&rsquo;s Hedge, a raised earthwork which extends for
7 m. in a straight line, as far as a larger camp, on Bury Down,
and is of Danish or Saxon construction. Trelawne, a fine old
mansion belonging to the family of Trelawny, dates in part
from the 15th century, but has been very largely restored.</p>

<p>The harbourage was probably the original cause of settlement
at Looe. At the time of the Domesday Survey East Looe
was assessed under Pendrym, which was of the king&rsquo;s demesne
and West Looe under Hamelin&rsquo;s manor of Trelowia. In the
14th century the former manor was held by the family of Bodrugan;
the latter by that of Dauney, who had inherited it from
the Treverbyns. In 1237 Henry Bodrugan received the grant
of a market on Fridays and a fair at Michaelmas in his manor of
Pendrym. In 1301 his grandson and namesake granted to East
Looe a market and fair, view of frank pledge, ducking stool and
pillory and assize of bread and ale. Otto Bodrugan in 1320
granted the burgesses the privilege of electing their own portreeve
and controlling the trade of the town. A charter of incorporation
was granted in 1558 under which the common council was to consist
of a mayor and 8 chief burgesses. There was to be a court
of record, a market on Saturdays and fairs at Michaelmas and
Candlemas. In 1685 James II. provided that there should be a
mayor and 11 aldermen, 36 free burgesses, 4 fairs and a court of
pie powder. East Looe was governed under this charter until
1885. West Looe (known also as Porpighan or Porbuan) benefited
by a charter granted by Richard king of the Romans to
Odo Treverbyn and ratified in 1325 constituting it a free borough
whose burgesses were to be free of all custom throughout Cornwall.
Residence for a year and a day within the borough
conferred freedom from servitude. There were to be a market
on Wednesdays and a fair at Michaelmas. Hugh son of Odo
Treverbyn gave West Looe the privileges enjoyed by Helston
and Launceston. Upon the attainder of the earl of Devon in
1539 the borough fell to the crown and was annexed to the
duchy. In 1574 a charter of incorporation was granted, providing
for a mayor and 11 burgesses, also for a market on Wednesdays
and two fairs. West Looe continued to be administered under
this charter until 1869, when the death of the mayor deprived
the council of its only surviving member and elector. Parliamentary
representation was conferred upon East Looe in 1571
and upon West Looe in 1553. In the debate on the reform bill
O&rsquo;Connell stated that there was but one borough more rotten
than East Looe and that was West Looe. Looe was second only
to Fowey as a port in the 15th century. It furnished 20 ships for
the siege of Calais. Of the markets and fairs only the markets on
Wednesdays and Saturdays and a fair on the 6th of May remain.</p>

most commonly used both in the British Islands and in North
America for all species of the genus <i>Colymbus</i>, or <i>Eudytes</i> according
to some ornithologists, frequently with the prefix sprat,
indicating the fish on which they are supposed to prey; though
it is the local name of the great crested grebe (<i>Podiceps cristatus</i>)
wherever that bird is sufficiently well known to have one; and,
<span class="correction" title="amended from ns">as</span> appears from Grew (<i>Mus. Reg. Soc.</i> p. 69), it was formerly
given to the little grebe or dabchick (<i>P. fluviatilis</i> or <i>minor</i>).
The other form loo<i>m</i> seems more confined in its application to
the north, and is said by T. Edmonston (<i>Etym. Gloss. Shetl.

of <i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>;<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> but it has come into use among
Arctic seamen as the name of the guillemot (<i>Alca arra</i> or

opening; similarly a ring of metal or other material leaving an
aperture. (2) In architecture or fortification, &ldquo;loop,&rdquo; more
usually in the form &ldquo;loophole,&rdquo; is an opening in the wall of
a building, very narrow on the outside and splayed within,
from which arrows or darts might be discharged on an enemy,
or through which light might be admitted. They are often in
the form of a cross, and generally have round holes at the ends
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oillets</a></span>). (3) The word is also a term in iron and steel
manufacturing for a mass of metal ready for hammering or rolling,

<p>This last word is represented in French by <i>loupe</i>, from which it is
probably adapted. The earlier English form was also <i>loupe</i>, and it
was also applied to precious stones which were of inferior brilliancy;
the same also appears in French. Of the word in its two first
meanings, a bend or circle in a line of string, metal, rails, &amp;c., and
&ldquo;loophole,&rdquo; the derivation is uncertain. Skeat takes the word in
both meanings to be the same and to be of Scandinavian origin, the
old Norwegian <i>hlaup</i>, a leap, being the direct source. The base is the
Teutonic <i>hlaufan</i>, to run, to leap, German <i>laufen</i>. The <i>New English
Dictionary</i> considers the Swedish example, <i>löp-knut</i>, &ldquo;running knot,&rdquo;
and others given by Skeat in support of his derivation to be Germanisms,
and also that the pronunciation of the word would have been
<i>lowp</i> rather than <i>l&#363;p</i>. &ldquo;Loop&rdquo; in meaning (2) &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; is also
taken to be a different word, and is derived from Dutch <i>luipen</i>, to

<p><span class="bold">LOPES, FERNÃO<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (1380?-1459?), the patriarch of Portuguese
historians, was appointed keeper of the royal archives, then
housed in the castle of St George in Lisbon, by King John I.
in November 1418. He acted as private secretary to the Infants
D. Duarte and D. Fernando, and when the former ascended the
throne he charged Lopes, by letter of the 19th of March 1434,
with the work of &ldquo;putting into chronicles the stories of the kings
of old time as well as the great and lofty actions of the most
virtuous king my lord and father&rdquo; (John I.). The form of the
appointment marked its limits, and is a sufficient reply to those
modern critics who have censured Lopes for partiality. Notwithstanding
his official title of chief chronicler of the realm,
he was the king&rsquo;s man (<i>Vassallo del Rei</i>), and received his salary
from the royal treasury. King Alphonso V. confirmed him in
his post by letter of the 3rd of June 1449, and in 1454, after
thirty-six years&rsquo; service in the archives and twenty as chronicler,
he resigned in favour of Gomez Eannes de Azurara. The latter
pays a tribute to his predecessor as &ldquo;a notable person, a man of
rare knowledge and great authority,&rdquo; and the modern historian
Herculano says, &ldquo;there is not only history in the chronicles of
Fernão Lopes, there is poetry and drama as well; there is the
middle age with its faith, its enthusiasm, its love of glory.&rdquo;
Lopes has been called the Portuguese Froissart, and that rare
gift, the power of making their subjects live, is common to the
two writers; indeed, had the former written in a better-known
language, there can be little doubt that the general opinion of
critics would have confirmed that of Robert Southey, who called
Lopes &ldquo;beyond all comparison the best chronicler of any age
or nation.&rdquo; Lopes was the first to put in order the stories of the
earlier Portuguese monarchs, and he composed a general chronicle
of the kingdom, which, though it never appeared under his name,
almost certainly served as a foundation for the chronicles of Ruy
de Pina (<i>q.v.</i>). Lopes prepared himself for his work with care
and diligence, as he tells us, not only by wide reading of books
in different languages, but also by a study of the archives belonging
to municipalities, monasteries and churches, both in
Portugal and Spain. He is usually a trustworthy guide in facts,
and charms the reader by the naïve simplicity of his style.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOPEZ, CARLOS ANTONIO<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> (1790-1862), Paraguayan autocrat,
was born at Asuncion on the 4th of November 1790, and
was educated in the ecclesiastical seminary of that city. He
attracted the hostility of the dictator, Francia, and he was
forced to keep in hiding for several years. He acquired, however,
so unusual a knowledge of law and governmental affairs that,
on Francia&rsquo;s death in 1840, he obtained an almost undisputed
control of the Paraguayan state, which he maintained uninterruptedly
until his death on the 10th of September 1862.
He was successively secretary of the ruling military <i>junta</i> (1840-1841),
one of the two consuls (1841-1844), and president with
dictatorial powers (1844-1862) by successive elections for ten
and three years, and in 1857 again for ten years, with power
to nominate his own successor. Though nominally a president
acting under a republican constitution, he ruled despotically.
His government was in general directed with wise energy towards
developing the material resources and strengthening the military
power of the country. His jealousy of foreign approach several
times involved him in diplomatic disputes with Brazil, England,
and the United States, which nearly resulted in war, but each
time he extricated himself by skilful evasions.</p>

<p>His eldest son, <span class="sc">Francisco Solano Lopez</span> (1826-1870), was
born near Asuncion on the 24th of July 1826. When in his
nineteenth year he was made commander-in-chief of the Paraguayan
army, during the spasmodic hostilities then prevailing
with the Argentine Republic. He was sent in 1853 as minister
to England, France and Italy, and spent a year and a half in
Europe. He purchased large quantities of arms and military
supplies, together with several steamers, and organized a project
for building a railroad and establishing a French colony in
Paraguay. He also formed the acquaintance of Madame Lynch,
an Irish adventuress of many talents and popular qualities,
who became his mistress, and strongly influenced his later
ambitious schemes. Returning to Paraguay, he became in
1855 minister of war, and on his father&rsquo;s death in 1862 at once
assumed the reins of government as vice-president, in accordance
with a provision of his father&rsquo;s will, and called a congress by
which he was chosen president for ten years. In 1864, in his
self-styled capacity of &ldquo;protector of the equilibrium of the
La Plata,&rdquo; he demanded that Brazil should abandon her armed
interference in a revolutionary struggle then in progress in
Uruguay. No attention being paid to his demand, he seized
a Brazilian merchant steamer in the harbour of Asuncion,
and threw into prison the Brazilian governor of the province
of Matto Grosso who was on board. In the following month
(December 1864) he despatched a force to invade Matto Grosso,
which seized and sacked its capital Cuyabá, and took possession
of the province and its diamond mines. Lopez next sought
to send an army to the relief of the Uruguayan president Aguirro
against the revolutionary aspirant Flores, who was supported by
Brazilian troops. The refusal of the Argentine president, Mitre,
to allow this force to cross the intervening province of Corrientes,
was seized upon by Lopez as an occasion for war with the
Argentine Republic. A congress, hastily summoned, and composed
of his own nominees, bestowed upon Lopez the title of
marshal, with extraordinary war powers, and on April 13, 1865,
he declared war, at the same time seizing two Argentine war-vessels
in the bay of Corrientes, and on the next day occupied
the town of Corrientes, instituted a provisional government
of his Argentine partisans, and summarily announced the annexation
to Paraguay of the provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios.
Meantime the party of Flores had been successful in Uruguay,
and that state on April the 18th united with the Argentine
Republic in a declaration of war on Paraguay. On the 1st of
May Brazil joined these two states in a secret alliance, which
stipulated that they should unitedly prosecute the war &ldquo;until
the existing government of Paraguay should be overthrown,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page991" id="page991"></a>991</span>
and &ldquo;until no arms or elements of war should be left to it.&rdquo;
This agreement was literally carried out. The war which
ensued, lasting until the 1st of April 1870, was carried on with
great stubbornness and with alternating fortunes, though with
a steadily increasing tide of disasters to Lopez (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paraguay</a></span>).
In 1868, when the allies were pressing him hard, his mind, naturally
suspicious and revengeful, led him to conceive that a conspiracy
had been formed against his life in his own capital and
by his chief adherents. Thereupon several hundred of the chief
Paraguayan citizens were seized and executed by his order,
including his brothers and brothers-in-law, cabinet ministers,
judges, prefects, military officers, bishops and priests, and nine-tenths
of the civil officers, together with more than two hundred
foreigners, among them several members of the diplomatic
legations. Lopez was at last driven with a mere handful of
troops to the northern frontier of Paraguay, where, on the 1st of
April 1870, he was surprised by a Brazilian force and killed
as he was endeavouring to escape by swimming the river
Aquidaban.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOPEZ DE GÓMARA, FRANCISCO<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1510?-1555?), Spanish
historian, was educated at the university of Alcalá, where he
took orders. Soon after 1540 he entered the household of the
famous Cortés, who supplied him with most of the material for
his <i>Historia de las Indias</i> (1552), and <i>Crónica de la conquista de
Nueva España</i> (1552). The pleasing style and novel matter
enchanted the Spanish public, but the unmeasured laudation of
Cortés at the expense of his lieutenants and companions brought
about a violent reaction. Though the <i>Historia</i> was dedicated to
Charles V., both works were forbidden on the 17th of November
1553, and no editions of them were issued between 1554 and 1727.
Italian and French versions of his books were published in 1556
and 1578 respectively.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LOP-NOR<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> or Lob-nor, a lake of Central Asia, in the Gobi
Desert, between the Astin-tagh (Altyn-tagh) on the south and
the Kuruk-tagh on the north. Previous to 1876 it was placed in
nearly all maps at 42° 30&prime; N., a position which agreed with the
accounts and the maps of ancient Chinese geographers. In the
year mentioned the Russian explorer Przhevalsky discovered
two closely connected lake-basins, Kara-buran and Kara-koshun,
fully one degree farther south, and considerably east of the site of
the old Lop-nor, which lake-basins he nevertheless regarded as
being identical with the old Lop-nor of the Chinese. But the
water they contained he pronounced to be fresh water. This
identification was disputed by Baron von Richthofen, on the
ground that the Lop-nor, the &ldquo;Salt Lake&rdquo; of the Chinese
geographers, could not be filled with fresh water; moreover,
being the final gathering basin of the desert stream, the Tarim, it
was bound to be salt, more especially as the lake had no outflow.
Przhevalsky visited the Lop-nor region again in 1885, and
adhered to his opinion. But ten years later it was explored anew
by Dr Sven Hedin, who ascertained that the Tarim empties part
of its waters into another lake, or rather string of lakes (Avullu-köl,
Kara-köl, Tayek-köl and Arka-köl), which <i>are</i> situated in 42°
30&prime; N., and thus so far justified the views of von Richthofen, and
confirmed the Chinese accounts. At the same time he advanced
reasons for believing that Przhevalsky&rsquo;s lake-basins, the southern
Lop-nor, are of quite recent origin&mdash;indeed, he fixed upon 1720 as
the probably approximate date of their formation, a date which
von Richthofen would alter to 1750. Besides this, Sven Hedin
argued that there exists a close inter-relation between the northern
Lop-nor lakes and the southern Lop-nor lakes, so that as the
water in the one group increases, it decreases to the same proportion
and volume in the other. He also argued that the four lakes
of northern Lop-nor are slowly moving westwards under the
incessant impetus of wind and sandstorm (<i>buran</i>). These conclusions
were afterwards controverted by the Russian traveller,
P. K. Kozlov, who visited the Lop-nor region in 1893-1894&mdash;that
is, before Dr Sven Hedin&rsquo;s examination. He practically only
reiterated Przhevalsky&rsquo;s contention, that the ancient Chinese
maps were erroneously drawn, and that the Kara-koshun, in
spite of the freshness of its water, was the old Lop-nor, <i>the</i> Salt
Lake <i>par excellence</i> of the Chinese. Finally, in 1900, Dr Sven
Hedin, following up the course of the Kum-darya, discovered&mdash;at
the foot of the Kuruk-tagh, and at the E. (lowest) extremity of
the now desiccated Kuruk-darya, with traces of dead forest and
other vegetation beside it and beside the river-bed&mdash;the basin of
a desiccated salt lake, which he holds to be the true ancient
Lop-nor of the Chinese geographers, and at the same time he
found that the Kara-koshun or Lop-nor of Przhevalsky had
extended towards the north, but shrunk on the south. Thus the
old Lop-nor no longer exists, but in place of it there are a number
of much smaller lakes of newer formation. It may fairly be
inferred that, owing to the uniform level of the region, the
sluggish flow of the Tarim, its unceasing tendency to divide and
reunite, conjoined with the violence and persistency of the winds
(mostly from the east and north-east), and the rapid and dense
growth of the reed-beds in the shallow marshes, the drainage
waters of the Tarim basin gather now in greater volume
in one depression, and now in greater volume in another; and
this view derives support from the extreme shallowness of the
lakes in both Sven Hedin&rsquo;s northern Lop-nor and Przhevalsky&rsquo;s
southern Lop-nor, together with the uniformly horizontal level
of the entire region.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORAIN,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a city of Lorain county, Ohio, U.S.A., on Lake Erie,
at the mouth of the Black river, and about 25 m. W. by S. of
Cleveland. Pop. (1890) 4863; (1900) 16,028, of whom 4730
were foreign-born and 359 negroes; (1910 census) 28,883.
Lorain is served by the New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis, and the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio railways, by the Lake Shore Electric railway,
and by several of the more important steamboat lines on the Great
Lakes. It has a Carnegie library, the Lake View Hospital and
the Saint Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital. There is a good harbour, and the
city&rsquo;s chief interests are in the shipping of great quantities of
coal, iron-ore, grain and lumber, in the building of large steel
vessels, in railway shops, and in the manufacture of iron pipes,
gas engines, stoves and automatic steam shovels. The value of
the factory products increased from $9,481,388 in 1900 to
$14,491,091 in 1905, or 52.8%. The municipality owns and
operates the waterworks. A Moravian mission was established
here in 1787-1788, and a trading post in 1807, but no permanent
settlement was made until several years later. In 1836 the place
was incorporated as a village under the name &ldquo;Charleston&rdquo;;
in 1874 the present name was adopted, and in 1896 Lorain became
a city of the second class.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORALAI,<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> a town and district of India, in Baluchistan. The
town, which is situated 4700 ft. above the sea, 35 m. by road from
the railway station of Harnai, was occupied as a military station
in 1886, and has quarters for a native cavalry and a native
infantry regiment. Pop. (1901) 3561.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Loralai</span> was formed in 1903. It consists of
a series of long, narrow valleys, hemmed in by rugged mountains,
and bordered E. by Dera Ghazi Khan district of the Punjab.
Area 7999 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 67,864, of whom the majority are
Afghans. The principal crops are wheat and millet; but the
chief wealth of the inhabitants is derived from their herds of
cattle, sheep and goats.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORCA,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> a town of eastern Spain, in the province of Murcia, on
the right bank of the river Sangonera (here called the Guadalantin
or Guadalentin) and on the Murcia-Baza railway. Pop. (1900)
69,836. It occupies a height crowned by a medieval fortress,
among the foothills of the Sierra del Caño. Its older parts,
Moorish in many features and with narrow irregular streets,
contrast with the modern parts, which have broad streets and
squares, and many fine public buildings&mdash;theatre, town hall,
hospitals, courts of justice and a bridge over the Sangonera.
There is an important trade in agricultural products and live
stock, as well as manufactures of woollen stuffs, leather, gunpowder,
chemicals and porcelain. Silver, sulphur and lead are
found in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Lorca is the Roman <i>Eliocroca</i> (perhaps also the <i>Ilorci</i> of Pliny,
<i>N.H.</i> iii. 3) and the Moorish <i>Lurka</i>. It was the key of Murcia
during the Moorish wars, and was frequently taken and retaken.
On the 30th of April 1802 it suffered severely by the bursting of
the reservoir known as the Pantano de Puentes, in which the
waters of the Sangonera were stored for purposes of irrigation
(1775-1785); the district adjoining the river, known
as the Barrio de San Cristobal, was completely ruined, and
more than six hundred persons perished. In 1810 Lorca
suffered greatly from the French invasion. In 1886 the
Pantano, which was one of the largest of European reservoirs,
being formed by a dam 800 ft. long and 160 ft. high, was
successfully rebuilt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD, JOHN<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1810-1894), American historical writer and
lecturer, was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the 27th
of December 1810. He was the nephew of Nathan Lord (1792-1870),
president of Dartmouth College from 1828 to 1863. He
graduated at Dartmouth in 1833, and at Andover Theological
Seminary in 1837. His course at the Seminary was interrupted
by a period of teaching&mdash;at Windham, Connecticut (1834),
and at Norwich (1834-1835)&mdash;and by a tour in 1836 through
New York and Ohio, in which he lectured on the dark ages.
He was agent and lecturer for the American Peace Society
(1837-1839), and for a brief time was a Congregational pastor
in turn at New Marlboro and West Stockbridge, Massachusetts,
and at Utica, New York. About 1840 he became a professional
lecturer on history. He lectured extensively for fifty years,
especially in the United States and Great Britain, and introduced,
with success, the mid-day lecture. He was lecturer on history in
Dartmouth from 1869 to 1876. He received, in 1864, the degree
of LL.D. from the University of the City of New York. From
1854 he made his home in Stamford, Connecticut, where he
died on the 15th of December 1894. His works include,
besides several school and college histories, <i>The Old Roman
World: the Grandeur and Failure of Civilization</i> (1867); <i>Ancient
States and Empires</i> (1869); <i>Two German Giants: Frederick the
Great and Bismarck</i> (1885); and <i>Beacon Lights of History</i>
(8 vols., 1884-1896), his chief contribution to historical
literature.</p>

<p>See <i>The Life of John Lord</i> (1896) by Rev. Alexander S. Twombley,
D. D. (in &ldquo;Beacon Lights of History&rdquo;), which is based chiefly upon
Lord&rsquo;s <i>Reminiscences of Fifty Years in the Lecture Field</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>hláford</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>hláfweard</i>, the warder or keeper
of bread, <i>hláf</i>, loaf; the word is not represented in any other
Teutonic language), in its primary sense, the head of a household,
the master of those dependent on him for their daily bread,
correlative to O. Eng. <i>hláf-aéta</i>, loaf-eater, servant; the word
frequently occurs in this sense in the Bible, cf. Matt. xxiv. 45.
As a term implying the ownership of property, &ldquo;lord&rdquo; survives
in &ldquo;lord of the manor&rdquo; and &ldquo;landlord.&rdquo; The chief applications
are due to its use as the equivalent of Lat. <i>dominus</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="kyrios">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>
and Fr. <i>seigneur</i>; thus in the Old Testament it represents
<i>Yahweh</i>, Jehovah, and in the New Testament <span class="grk" title="kyrios">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>, as a
title of Jesus Christ. Selden&rsquo;s words may be quoted for the
more general meanings of &ldquo;lord&rdquo;; &ldquo;the name Dominus is ...
to be thought of only as a distinguishing attribute of Greatness
and as our English word Lord is; and that without any relation
of it to an Interest of property or to servitude, and only as it
denotes such Superiours as King or Subjects of the greater
Nobility with us and men of special Eminency in other States,
known by the names of Heeren, Dons, Sieurs, signiors, seigneurs
... and the like.&rdquo; It is thus not only a general word for a
prince or sovereign, but also the common word for a feudal
superior, and particularly of a feudal tenant holding directly
of the king, a baron (<i>q.v.</i>), hence a peer of the realm, a member
of the House of Lords, constituted of the lords temporal and
the lords spiritual; this is the chief modern usage. The prefix
&ldquo;lord&rdquo; is ordinarily used as a less formal alternative to the
full title, whether held by right or by courtesy, of marquess,
earl or viscount, and is always so used in the case of a baron
(which in English usage is generally confined to the holder of
a foreign title). Where the name is territorial, the &ldquo;of&rdquo; is
dropped, thus, the marquess of A., but Lord A. The younger
sons of dukes and marquesses have, by courtesy, the title of
Lord prefixed to the Christian and surname, <i>e.g.</i> Lord John
Russell. In the case of bishops, the full and formal title of
address is the Lord Bishop of A., whether he be a spiritual peer
or not. Many high officials of the British government have the
word &ldquo;lord&rdquo; prefixed to their titles; some of them are treated
in separate articles; for lord privy seal see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Privy Seal</a></span>. In
certain cases the members of a board which has taken the place of
an office of state are known as lords commissioners or, shortly,
lords of the office in question, <i>e.g.</i> lords of the treasury, civil
or naval lords of the admiralty. For lord lieutenant and lord
mayor see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lieutenant</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mayor</a></span>. As the proper form of
address &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; is used not only to those members of the
nobility to whom the title &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is applicable, and to bishops,
but also to all judges of the High Court in England, and of the
Scottish and Irish Superior Courts, and to lord mayors and
lord provosts (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lady</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">LORD ADVOCATE,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> or king&rsquo;s advocate, the principal law-officer
of the crown in Scotland. His business is to act as a
public prosecutor, and to plead in all causes that concern the
crown. He is at the head of the system of public prosecutions
by which criminal justice is administered in Scotland, and thus
his functions are of a far more extensive character than those
of the English law-officers of the crown. He is aided by a solicitor-general
and by subordinate assistants called advocates-depute.
The office of king&rsquo;s advocate seems to have been established
about the beginning of the 16th century. Originally he had no
power to prosecute crimes without the concurrence of a private
party; but in the year 1597 he was empowered to prosecute
crimes at his own instance. He has the privilege of pleading
in court with his hat on.</p>
